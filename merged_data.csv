AMZN,Amazon (AMZN) changes direction with its new business plan,118,117,1342116506,"""For years, Amazon has fought to avoid having to collect sales tax in order to keep its prices low. Now, though, it's given up on that that battle and instead looks set to launch a same-day delivery service—and that could destroy local retail as we know it.

Farhad Manjoo has put together a wonderfully insightful essay over at Slate which explores the impact Amazon's new strategy will have. To give some perspective, Amazon's decision to accept sales tax as inevitable means it can change its play. To avoid sales tax in the past, it had a handful of large distribution centers. Now it's set to charge sales tax, it can legally set up smaller distribution centers in any state. In turn, that in theory means it'll be able to ship products inside of the same day. As Manjoo points out, that would be incredibly disruptive: It's hard to overstate how thoroughly this move will shake up the retail industry. Same-day delivery has long been the holy grail of Internet retailers, something that dozens of startups have tried and failed to accomplish. (Remember Kozmo.com?) But Amazon is investing billions to make next-day delivery standard, and same-day delivery an option for lots of customers. If it can pull that off, the company will permanently alter how we shop. To put it more bluntly: Physical retailers will be hosed.

Whether Amazon can pull it off, of course, remains to be seen—and to gauge for yourself you should read the Slate feature—but it seems likely. After all, as Manjoo points out, if it can ship items cross-country overnight, it sure as hell should be able to get them across-state inside a day. And at that point, you can kiss your local stores goodbye.""

AMZN,Amazon's (AMZN) next move against brick-and-mortar stores: Amazon Lockers,91,90,1344458452,"""...Amazon has taken a small step toward eliminating the UPS wait with a service inspired less by the internet and more by the Port Authority. Amazon Locker allows you to have your packages sent to the equivalent of single-use P.O. boxes housed in 24-hour convenience stores, grocery stores and drug stores. Amazon sends you an email with a pickup code, which you enter on a touchscreen to open the door of the locker containing your package. You have three days from the delivery date to pick it up.

The lockers just arrived in 7-Elevens in the San Francisco Bay Area, and they’re already in place in Seattle, New York, Washington, D.C., and London. Clearly, they could be coming soon to a city near you, and Amazon’s brick-and-mortar competition should worry if they start to catch on.

With its rollout of same-day delivery, and now lockers, Amazon is steadily chipping away at reasons to walk into a store at all. Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter tells Marketplace that companies like Best Buy struggle in vain to compete against Amazon because the cost of keeping a physical store open adds about 10 percent to prices. Pachter says the ability to walk out of the store with the item you bought on the same day you walked in is one of the few advantages traditional retailers still have.

If Amazon can deliver your order the same day you placed it, and they have their own physical location for customers to take the delivery, then they’ll have nearly succeeded in matching all the selling points of a regular store while avoiding the vast majority of the overhead that managing a piece of real estate requires (The Wall Street Journal reports that Amazon pays a small fee to the owners of the stores that have its lockers). The only thing Amazon won’t have is the showroom.""

AAPL,(AAPL) insight for tomorrow ,37,99,1347415963,"As many of you already know, Apple (AAPL) will be announcing their latest iPhone tomorrow (11/12/12). I predict that history will repeat itself in the following weeks.

Looking into the past: 


On *June 7th, 2010*, Apple announced the iPhone 4. When the announcement was made, (AAPL) was priced at **~$250.94**. After the announcement (AAPL) stocks [declined](http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=AAPL+Interactive#symbol=aapl;range=20100607,20100609;compare=;indicator=bollinger+volume;charttype=area;crosshair=on;ohlcvalues=0;logscale=off;source=undefined;) ~-3.08% with a low of **~$243.20**. This was good for the people who decided to short and the people that wanted a cheaper in to (AAPL). After two days of declining, the next ***eleven*** days (AAPL) steadily began to [rise](http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=AAPL+Interactive#symbol=aapl;range=20100609,20100618;compare=;indicator=bollinger+volume;charttype=area;crosshair=on;ohlcvalues=0;logscale=off;source=undefined;) ~+12.69% ([+9.22% if the stock was purchased on announcement day](http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=AAPL+Interactive#symbol=aapl;range=20100607,20100618;compare=;indicator=bollinger+volume;charttype=area;crosshair=on;ohlcvalues=0;logscale=off;source=undefined;)) with a peak of **~$274.07** before retreating again to a **~$250** near the end of June.


This happened once more with a larger outcome. The announcement for the iPhone 4s was made on *October 4th, 2011*. The stock hit an intraday low of **~$354.24**. In the next *thirteen* days (AAPL) would [peak](http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=AAPL+Interactive#symbol=aapl;range=20111004,20111017;compare=;indicator=bollinger+volume;charttype=area;crosshair=on;ohlcvalues=0;logscale=off;source=undefined;) at **~$422** with ~+12.75% at the end of the day after the slight drop. 

Today (11/11/12), (AAPL) closed at **$660.59**. Looking at the two post-announcement pops, I predict a rise of ~+13% which would come out as somewhere around **~$746.46** as a target withing a time frame between *ten - fifteen days*.

I don't know what I should do now. Obviously, buy high sell low is a bad policy. But the market looks like it's set on remaining irrational indefinitely. Should I sell, walk away, and just stick to my 3 fund portfolio?

Edit: By popular demand, the play that put me in this position was a short put ladder. As I recall, my numbers were +580,+600, -605 (for the OTM, ATM, and ITM puts respectively).

AAPL,AAPL down on an Up day off Samsung Warning,22,88,1373064858,"Samsung issued an Earnings Warning due to selling less than expected flagship Galaxy S4 phones.

The overall stock market was up today, closing at Week highs, with the SP500 at approx 1632 (and bullishly over its 50dma for the first time all week).

AAPL however, opened flat at 422.50 (Wed's high); and went down all day before end of day bounce at 415, to close at 417 -4.

1) one can say this Samsung news is bullish for AAPL, in that the Galaxy S4 uptake while very high, is less than expected. Thus some might argue this is AAPL bullish.

2) others may say this is AAPL bearish as we perhaps this just means we are seeing a global slowdown in people buying every smartphone that comes out, as there is not that much real change today. Whereas in prior years, there was a tangible difference. People wanted the new one, whereas now, people seem happy with using a smartphone 2-3 years old and are not rushing to buy the new one. (from either Samsung or AAPL).

3) lol - BBRY clearly is not winning new business given their tankage of over 25% share price.

My own personal read is that now that late spring/summer is here : 
people will put any buying decision on hold until AAPL demos iPhone5s very shortly (rumor has it on sale Sep 20). 

IF iPhone5s has some amazing new must-have feature, or IF they finally make a larger screen size : that may be AAPL bullish, I don't know yet. but IF they do not make a bigger screen; and 5s is just a minor refresh of iPhone5; that will certainly be very AAPL bearish (imo).

Disclaimer: Net short AAPL for long time, was long earlier this week off the DipBuying at 400 off the iWatch Trademark Monday news. Closed said long (posted) at 421s, indicating my thoughts that 420-425 will now be major resistance. (thus little trade also of weekly credit call spread at 425 skew). When this was written (friday evening), simply Net Short via Jan 2014 Credit spread. (in other words, I'm still long term bearish)

I know that diversification is good for a portfolio but maybe I should sell some positions and get more concentrated.

GOOG,A new discussion re dilution in GOOG vs GOOGL,5,13,1397672938,"Recently, our GOOG shares were halved in value, renamed GOOGL and then new shares of GOOG were given to each of us on a 1 to 1 basis.  Much has been said of this split, but the one thing that I would like to know is why people wouldn't all ditch their GOOG for GOOGL right now, while they are close to parity?  

Don't get me wrong- I dont' care about voting rights that I get through GOOGL shares.  It's nice and all, but I'm a small time investor. And while I may fill out a proxy form now and again, my paltry shares aren't about to change this ship's heading anytime soon.  

What I do care about is future valuation.  Ignoring class B shares entirely, it is my understanding that 1/2 of the value of the company remained in GOOGL, and the other half was ""assigned"" to the new GOOG.  For this reason, they have come out of the gates trading fairly close to each other.    

But in the future, [Google's purchasing power](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mergers_and_acquisitions_by_Google) is said to come from both cash and from GOOG stock.  

Let's take this week's deal with Titan Aerospace.  I don't believe the specifics have been printed yet, but let's say the company is bought for X million dollars and Y shares of Google's stock.  That stock would be newly issued GOOG stock.  And that would do what this split intended, it would dilute the class C shares and maintain the class A/ shares as they were.  

So over time, wouldn't the class B shares be worth less and less compared to the non-diluted shares of GOOGL?  If that's the case, then aren't we better off buying a stable %age of the company instead of buying the part of the half of the company that will continue to be diluted after every single takeover?

AAPL,AAPL Proves Wall Street is Nuts,272,310,1401974587,"When Apple was at $700 per share a couple years ago, all the analysts had buy ratings and even higher price targets. Since then, the underlying business of the company has improved, they pay a shit-load of dividends, bought back stock, and weathered what you can arguably claim is a transition period of the company. Not to mention it's emerged with a stronger balance sheet and better fundamentals. 

But when the stock was around $400 per share, with the same underlying business, analysts said the company was an also-ran and recommended not to buy it. And now that it's back to to $650, they can't raise their price targets fast enough.

Uhhh, shouldn't it have been a buy when it was LOW? Now that the business itself hasn't changed (but rather only the stock price has) but the price has gone up 50% in the past year, isn't it less of a buy?

AAPL,A serious analysis of AAPL,123,61,1409914920,"I'm intrigued by the new opportunities that are expected in the next generation of Apple products and services. I think Apple is in the position to truly capitalize on their ecosystem and open a significant number of revenue streams. I'm going to detail them one by one, feel free to poke any holes that you may find.

iPhones: From the rumors in the NYT, Apple has ordered up to 40% more phones over last years holiday quarter (1). This would be in the realm of 70-80 million phones. For the previous q1, we were looking at 56% of their (2) $57B in revenues was from the iPhone, ~$32B. Adding 40% to that figure would give you ~$45B. There is a mixture of phones contributing to this though, and the older model phones will *probably* not see the 40% gain. For this analysis, we're going to say that is a negligible portion of the phones/revenues though. 

The kicker for this calculation though, is that there is a rumored higher end iPhone that will be available. The 5.5"" has been rumored to cost an additional $100 and possibly come with a bigger battery, higher resolution screen, and better camera. In my eyes, there are plenty of people willing to give Apple more money, and moving upmarket seems like a fantastic idea. My best estimate is this could be purchased by 20% of buyers, increasing the average selling price a further $20, from $636 (q1 14) to $656 (~3% increase). This leads to a projected revenue for iPhones of $46.5B.

iPads: I think the holiday season is where the iPad shines, they make great gifts and they're probably too expensive to be an impulse purchase the rest of the year. However, the replacement cycle isn't that quick and there doesn't seem to be any killer features on the horizon. My best guess at this market would be flat y/y at 26 million units, or approximately $12B.

Mac: I think the Mac line is poised for growth. They have been aggressively lowering their prices along which will make them much more appealing to people looking to get deeper into the Apple ecosystem. The continuity features look stunning to me and I think it will be one of the first catalysts in a long time to get people to upgrade their computer. Their Mac sales have been on an uptrend and I think the lower prices will help nudge consumers toward Apple's offerings. I think we'll see over 5.5 million Macs sold vs 4.8 in q1 14. However, with a lower selling price, the total revenue may only increase slightly. This would put us in the realm of $7B.

iCloud Services: One of the things I'm most excited about in the new generation of Apple products is the new and improved iCloud. It seems like it will finally be the service people need, fully integrated into Apple's products, and all at a competitive price. With pricing tiers ranging from $1 to $4 per month and above, this could become another great stream of revenue for Apple. Without any historic data it's quite difficult to gauge what percentage of users would begin this subscription, however I think Apple's freemium model for this service (first 5gb is free) will entice many customers to embrace it. My estimate would be 20% of active iPhones will pay for this service ($1+), and 30% of that group will pay for the higher tier ($4). If anyone has any data or speculation to adjust those numbers, I'd be happy to hear. That would mean (350 million active iPhones * .2) 70 million using the service with 21 million of those on the higher tier. We'll ignore the tiers above that as they probably won't be a significant number. That would be an additional $133 million a month, or $400M a quarter.


HomeKit: This looks like it will be a great licensing play for Apple. The prices of many of these products still needs to come down for mass adoption, but Apple is laying the groundwork to control your home and get their cut of the profits. I think it is too early to have any idea what kind of revenues Apple can expect to see from HomeKit, but it has the potential to significantly strengthen the Apple ecosystem and provide Apple with another stream of revenue.

HealthKit: See Above. 

iWallet (unnamed?): From the seemingly confirmed reports, Apple has managed to negotiate rates that are 15 to 25 (.15 to .25%) basis points below current transaction fees. I would assume that will be the cut Apple is going to take on all transactions processed through their new payment system. It looks like this payment system has the potential to work worldwide and hopefully won't be restricted to just a few countries. The best numbers I can find say that Visa processes over $3T a year, MasterCard does $2T, and AMEX does just shy of $1T (3). It's difficult to gauge how many of these credit card holders have iPhones, and then from there how many would embrace Apple's new service. It appears the average person spends $677 a month on each card (4). If Apple were able to get 75% of its users to embrace this on phones sold this year (we'll guess 200M phones sold this year), that would be ((150M*$677)*.0025) an additional $250M per month or $750M per quarter. This is also skewed by the fact that many people have multiple cards, and Apple customers would generally spend more than the average credit card holder. You could probably safely estimate an extra $1B+ per quarter, and more as the install base grows. On an added note, this should be one of the highest margin services Apple has. This will likely take some time to reach it's full potential as it is rumored to only work with the latest devices.

Beats Headphones + Beats Music: Beats apparently did 1.8B in revenues last year. I don't have much insight as to how they will act under Apple so I think saying flat would be a fair assessment. That would add another 450M per quarter, although more heavily weighted toward the holiday quarter.

iWatch/Wearable: I think it's too early to have any real idea what the financial breakdown of this new product will be. The price point is unknown, although rumored to be in the neighborhood of $400. I think something like $300 is more likely but we'll see. We'll come back to this after Tuesday when we hopefully will see what it can do and when it is expected to release.

AppleTV: If Apple ever manages to work out the proper deals, this could be a significant contributor to their bottom line. Until then though, it unfortunately won't be.

iTunes: iTunes has been growing incredibly, and combined with Apple's other services and software has contributed 8% of their bottom line. If it were continue it's growth it should provide about $5B in the next quarter.

Accessories: Accessories should grow in proportion to the iPad/Mac/iPhone growth and continue to contribute 3% to the bottom line. This would give you an additional $2.2B.

So for Q1 2015 (Holiday Quarter), based on the available data, you could be looking at nearly $75B in revenues. This additionally hinges on the iPhone 6 release date, if it were to be released later than Sept 28, it would artificially inflate Q1 2015 at the expense of Q4 2014 with opening week sales. Gross margins would be tough to estimate as even Apple has had trouble estimating them lately, but to be safe I would say something around 38%. This assumes the iWatch won't be released until next year, if they find a way to get it out before the holidays it could increase that amount by a couple billion. This also leaves Apple with some very appealing growth opportunities in services, licensing, and hardware. In a strong bull case, with the iPhone being released Sept 29 and the iWatch being sold before the holidays, and maybe an iPad Pro offering, Q1 '15 could get up to $80B+. 

A full 2015 projection would be approximately Q1 $75B + Q2 $65B + Q3 $53B + Q4 $57B = $250B. I calculated this based on Apple's general revenue pattern over the course of the year, including a bump in Q2 for when I expect the iWatch to be released. With a gross margin of 38% this would be $95B in gross profit, however with a higher priced phone in the mix, higher margin services, and the potential with licensing, I'd bump that up to 39.5%. Leaving you just shy of $99B in gross profit for 2015. After Op Ex and tax you should be left with around ($99B - $26B (Estimate)) = $73B - 26% Effective Tax Rate ... $57B net profit.

Extrapolating from there, that would be a $9.50 EPS. If Apple were to keep its P/E minus cash ($165B) of roughly 12, it would give you a share price of $140.

Much of this analysis is based on the NYT rumor of Apple increasing orders by 40%. If they ultimately don't increase that order or if for some reason they were unable to move all those phones, this would create a vastly different scenario.

This analysis excludes the iPod as I think its future is questionable going forward. 

I've made quite a few leaps of faith in this, and obviously had pretty limited data to work with. If you have any suggestions or improvements, I'm happy to learn.

Under the terms of the buyout agreement, SCTY shareholders will receive 0.11 shares of TSLA for each SolarCity share they own. 

The math on that:
TSLA price (9/16 close): $205.40
Implied SCTY takeout price: $22.59 ($205.40 * 0.11)

SCTY price (9/16 close): $17.50.

So, SCTY is trading 23 percent below its takeout price, implying significant uncertainty. There are a few reasons for this, I leave it to you to decide how valid they are, but I just thought this was really interesting and a sort of under-covered topic. 

If you think the deal's gonna close in Q4, now might be a ripe time to load up on SolarCity. On the other hand, it's still dependent on Tesla's stock price, so you need to be somewhat confident that Tesla will remain stable for the next few months.

GOOG,A $25bn Snapchat IPO? Look at FB / GOOG's IPO data for insight.,240,128,1475828758,"Here's the [WSJ story](http://www.wsj.com/articles/snapchat-parent-working-on-ipo-that-could-value-company-at-25-billion-or-more-sources-1475778314) with the following figures:

|Snapchat|2015A|2016E|2017E|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $60m | $250-350m | ~$1bn |

## GOOG

So what did Google look like in it's early years?

|Google|1999A|2000A|2001A|2002A|2003A|2004A|2005A|

|Revenue | $0m | $19m | $86m | $440m | $1,466m|$3,189m | $6,139m|

The IPO was in August 2004. It was values at $23bn in the IPO.

## FB

Next let's look at Facebook, whose IPO was in May 2012 valuing the business at $81bn

|Facebook|2009A|2010A|2011A|2012A|2013A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $777m | $1,974m | $3,711m | $5,089m | $7,872m|

## Well?

Both Facebook and Google were profitable at the time of their IPOs and they had shown an acceleration in their revenue growth. This got them 5 to 10x next year's forecast revenue, and 7 to 16x current year's forecast revenue. 

For me the key is proof that the topline in accelerating. Google's top line accelerated every year until the great recession. Facebook's stopped immediately after the IPO, crashing the stock, until the topline started ramping again in 2013.

## A Rocket or Rock?

If Snapchat's sales follow this path, then a $25bn will be a steal. If not, it'll be another Twitter.

## EDIT:

If you're curious on the stats for Twitter, it IPOed in Nov 2013. It's sales had been accelerating. The business was valued at $14bn, i.e. 10x the forecast year's sales.

# Description

They've a rather grand vision of themselves

> We seek to be Earth’s most customer-centric company. We are guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. In each of our segments, we serve our primary customer sets, consisting of consumers, sellers, developers, enterprises, and content creators. 

So what does that mean? 

Amazon.com, Inc. offers a range of products and services through its Websites. Both products it purchases for resale and products offered by 3rd parties. It's got 3 divisions:

* North America
* International
* Amazon Web Services (AWS)

So we all know the amazon.com service, but what's AWS? Well as a start-up, Stockflare's built upon AWS. And surprisingly some of Amazon's competitors, like Netflix also store all their mission critical code on AWS servers! AWS allows anyone launch an online service without owning severs themselves. Nice eh? Wait until you see the margin. :)

And when it comes to innovation... well there is AWS okay, then there is the Kindle, and Amazon Prime, and Amazon Local, and Originals,  etc etc...so the Bezos vision... of the ""Everything Store"" is coming together!

## Recent financials 

THe growth is shocking, in a good way. 

|Metric|2015A|2014A|2013A|2012A|2011A|
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Revenue | $107bn | $89bn | $74bn | $61bn | $48bn|
|EPS | $1.25 | -$0.52 | $0.59 | -$0.09 | $1.37|

And for 2016 the forecast is sales of $137bn.

When it comes to profit's it's sort of *funny*, as it's AWS that turns a profit, with the North America and International divisions flip in and out of profit. Yes, they are investing, I know. Here's the first 9 months of 2016:

|9M 2016|Sales|Operating Profit| % |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|North America | $53.5bn | $1.5bn | 3% | 
|International | $30.0bn | -$0.8bn | -ve | 
|AWS | $8.7bn | $2.2bn | 25% |

## Competition

The competition section of their annuals rather funny, as they say pretty much everyone is their competitor, though they divide them into 7 groups:

1. all retailers
2. publishers, producers, media distributors of all distribution channels
3. search engines & social networks
4. e-commerce companies
5. fulfilment & logistics 
6. cloud computing IT firms
7. electronic device manufacturers

But to keep our lives simple, let's look at retail-first and digital-first competitors.

At a glance the margin looks good relative to WMT and COST. Though quite a bit behind HD. 

Given the structure of it's business I can't see it ever getting to Google of Netflix's margins, though if we look at the margins of AWS they aren't as good as the digital competitors, though it's not a fair comparison since they are not infrastructure based IT services companies. Though [Rackspace](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/rax/breakdown/latest) has a 32% margin v 25% for AWS.

|Companies|Latest Sales|Operating Profit|Return on Equity|
|---------|:------------:|:----------------:|:----------------:|
Amazon.com, Inc. | $127,993M | 9% | 14%
Retail-First | | | 
Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. | $484,604M | 7% | 18%
Home Depot Inc | $93,368M | 16% | 116%
Costco Wholesale Corporation | $118,719M | 4% | 21%
Digital-First | | | 
Alibaba Group Holding Ltd | $18,163M | 36% | 15%
Alphabet Inc | $85,537M | 33% | 15%
Netflix, Inc. | $8,176M | 59% | 7%
eBay Inc | $8,906M | 34% | 28%

However, given Bezos' vision and his focus on being always cheaper it's not impossible that they shall always have a slightly lower margin than their competitors. But if the top line's good, well who cares!

## Cash / Debt?

Amazon.com, Inc. has $10,142M of net cash. That is the equivalent of 3% of the market value of Amazon.com, Inc. so if they woke up one day and decided to buy Snapchat from under Zuckerberg's nose it wouldn't be hard to do!

# Wall Street thinks?

The professionals on Wall Street have a $922.38 for Amazon.com, Inc. and their recommendation to clients is _Buy_. That implies an upside of 18% to their target.

# Valuation

It's really hard to see the logic behind that $920 price target. It's clearly not PE driven...however, if you look at price to sales, and say that AMZN's current 2.6x forecast sales will rise to the sector average of 3.2x sales, then sure!

[View Peers](https://stockflare.com/$/stocks/amzn.o/breakdown/peers)|Valuation|Forecast PE|Long-term Growth|Dividend Yield|FCF Yield|
|:--------|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
AMZN.O | $370,630M | 164x | 35% | 0% | 3%
Retail-First | |  |  |  | 
WMT | $214,579M | 16x | 1% | 3% | 14%
HD | $158,425M | 20x | 14% | 2% | 8%
COST.O | $66,080M | 25x | 10% | 1% | 7%
Digital-First | |  |  |  | 
BABA.K | $231,090M | 29x | 27% | 0% | 3%
GOOGL.O | $535,531M | 23x | 19% | 0% | 5%
NFLX.O | $50,622M | 295x | 64% | 0% | 9%
EBAY.O | $32,420M | 15x | 8% | 0% | 8%

But frankly, I find it hard to believe that these metrics are really anything more than a place to hang your emotional belief in Bezos.

# Dividends

Amazon.com, Inc. is not forecast to pay a dividend this year. The company hasn't ever paid one. And although they have a 6 year old authorisation to buy back stock, they rarely do it. In effect... it's invest invest invest at Amazon.

# Catalysts

In the last 3 months the stock price has moved by 2% that compares with a change in the earnings forecasts of -17%. Wow. Obviously at 160x this years earnings, the EPS figure is irrelevant today. In fact, perhaps the key is the believe in 2017 and beyond. For example the current forecast is for sales to grow 20%+ and earnings to double.

On the management team's latest call with Wall Street brokers, they were tight lipped about 2017 and it's funny that anytime someone highlighted a potential negative, e.g. lower margins in International, the immediate response is ""we are investing"".

So, I suppose the history of them investing is pretty consistent, and to date their investment has continued to drive topline growth, impressively. They are bigger than HD and COST now in terms of sales. It would be a brave person to bet they won't be larger than Wal-Mart in the next 20 years. Maybe 10 years?

Of course, that won't stop the stock periodically dropping $100-150 a share when the market loses confidence in AMZN, though it appears to typically be temporary *lovers' tiffs*. 

For now, I think I'll await the next tiff.

GOOG,How to spot a dog (or god) in tech IPOs (Medium post) inc. $SNAP $GOOG $PF,18,22,1481015590,"[Here's a post](https://medium.com/simple-but-not-easy/how-to-spot-a-dog-or-god-in-tech-ipos-a5ec6b1b90a9#.4mynk8x4u) I wrote for the **Simple, Not Easy** publication at Medium.

Am highlighting the dangers of getting excited about upcoming IPOs like Snapchat. Especially when there are no number!

Love to hear the feedback on the 3 rules of thumb:

* Rule number 1: watch for the hype
* Rule number 2: expect zero shares at the IPO price
* Rule number 3: think long term not short

And love to hear if you agree with my premise that *accelerating sales* is the best way to identify great tech investments.

Thanks a mil,

Shane

AAPL,Apple is no longer the most valuable brand in the world as Google takes top spot,3091,198,1486041283,"Apple Inc.’s brand value and its position on the list of most valuable brands in the world have slipped, according to the latest Brand Finance Global 500 report.

TSLA,"Tesla ($TSLA) Units, Revenue, and Stock Price projection thru 2025",227,174,1492437592,"Over the last three years I posted two models that attempted to look into the future of Tesla and the correlating price.

I've updated the sheet to include all the different changes/events that have happened in the last 3 years to come up with a more inclusive (and complete) projection of TSLA thru 2025 based on the latest guidance from the company. To summarize:

* Tesla is guiding for 500k car units sold in 2018, 1m by 2020 (model reflects a more conservative approach at 80% of guidance).
* Since 3 years ago along with its purchase of Solar City, Tesla has announced new vehicles and products that it will be adding to its catalog. Including Model 3 (mid-size $35k sedan), these are Model Y (mid-size SUV), a Pick Up truck, a Semi Truck, a ""Mini Bus"", a solar roof, solar panels, battery storage, and a ride sharing business. All of these can be found in Tesla's [Master Plan, Part Deux post](https://www.tesla.com/blog/master-plan-part-deux).
* Tesla is projecting its Energy division to be as large as its car/transportation division, with an S curve growth (i.e. exponential) in the coming months.

Based on these, I've create a yearly chart of my projected units sold by category, revenue, and expected GM%. Quick note:

* I'm projecting the Tesla Freight (semi truck) and Bus to be a service model, not one where companies are expected to purchase the truck or bus outright (i.e. Tesla becomes a 3PL provider with fully autonomous trucks). I've modeled these on 100% margin on an expected profit amount that I think they'll be able to draw from each unit on a yearly basis.
* I have no idea what the per-unit price of the storage business extrapolates to, so I attempted to model it based on a % of total business. Don't pay too much attention to the unit figures under the storage business.

I'm setting a price target of $733 using 2021 figure for revenue of $91.7bn. You can use this same exercise for any of the figures on the model (i.e. if you want to assuming price based on 2025 revenue, you can apply the same math above to arrive at a stock price). I'm assuming the following:

* 10% EBITDA to Revenue ratio based on guidance from Elon Musk on one of their 2015 earnings calls. I'm using this to remove the assumption that Tesla will forever be in maximum growth mode (i.e. reinvesting all profits back into the company)
* A P/E ratio of 15
* 20% discount based on risks (Model 3 launch, macro environment, etc.)

GOOG,Engineer here: this is how you analyze GOOG as a quant,0,48,1495580936,"A few weeks ago I started trying to find undervalued companies and invest in them. This lead me to two stocks $GBX and $CTB. Well, $CTB and value investing in general turned out to be a huge turd so I *liquidated my position*. This freed up some cash to try new ideas. 

I've decided to switch from value investing to becoming a quant. Now from what I can tell, the details are scarce, quants do a lot of statistics calculations on stocks. As a learning exercise I used google sheets to analyze a stock everyone loves: $GOOG.

Here is the [spreadsheet] (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vJFb-DXU68phDNs3kVzpyGupHTFs_zgaxqzrcikCPrI/) where I calculate some commonly used statistic functions manually and compare it with the excel result. I wouldn't be a good engineer if the results weren't checked to be exactly the same.

These are the quantities computed:

* mean 843.0914433
* standard deviation 42.96703245
* covariance (to S&P500) 1366.739769
* correlation (to S&P500) 0.7318863498
* beta (to S&P500) 0.7235560557

To give some perspective:

* 50 years old

* Graduated from a no-name college with a business degree (paid my own way, had about $20,000 in student loans when I graduated)

* First year out of college made $21,000.  Was at $58,000 when I was 29.  Highest year was about $125,000, but have averaged around $100,000 for the past 10 years.

* Pretty much all from putting as much as I could manage, or was permitted, into 401K and IRAs.  About 65% of the total is traditional retirement, 30% ROTH, and 5% non-retirement.

* I bought cheap used cars when I was under 25.  But then bought a new car and drove it for 20 years.

* The only ""bonus"" along the way was I had a job that I got 6 months severance (around $35,000) and got another job right away, so I had ""double income"" for that 6 months.

* 100% self-managed, primarily through an E*Trade account.

* I pretty much buy and just let it sit.  Last time I sold anything was about 3 years ago when I last rebalanced.  I held all through the 2009 recession and lost about 60%.  I've always invested pretty aggressively, so I got hit hard when it went down, but I've recovered well as it's gone up.

* I pretty much focus on mutual funds now after getting my ass handed to me on individual stocks a few times.  The few I have left are ""sentimental"".  The SIRI and MSFT I've owned since 2001.  The FB I bought in the IPO.  BABA was bought shortly after the IPO.

* I opened my first brokerage account with $2,000 in Ameritrade in 1997 thinking I was going to jump on the internet bubble.  I bought and sold weekly and rode that baby down.  I basically never made any money, and when the whole thing crashed, my $2,000 literally got down to like $37.  So many internet stocks that just evaporated.

Out of the four of them, Microsoft looks like the most solid buy, and not just because they’re the only American company aside from J&J to have a AAA credit rating.

Apple is a victim of its own success. The iPhone X will reportedly be discontinued due to it’s unjustifiably large thousand dollar+ price tag and lagging sales. Which is why the gold iPhone X was never introduced and the Product Red iPhone 8 is being promoted instead. Apple has invented nothing impressive after Jobs’ passing. The Apple Watch is a flop with apps being removed including Instagram, Amazon, Google Maps, EBay, Slack, and more, most likely due to a lack of use. Now the flip side to the argument as to why you should invest in AAPL is that Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is invested in Apple, and as of this writing AAPL is actually their largest holding. Buffett’s reasoning because Apple has a large “moat” meaning that consumer loyalty to the brand is super impressive. But with HomePod completely missing the targets and being a thorough disappointment with an inept Siri and again super high price tag, Apple is pushing the limits on what it can get away with. Maybe the Oracle of Omaha sees something I don’t, but when I want to see the cutting edge in technology I go to the Microsoft Store to test out Hololens, not see another iteration of the iPad Pro which now supports Pencil.

Google is a mixed bag with awesome strengths as well as warning signs it may just be a follower in the industry, and not a good one at that. The strengths of Google are that it still has a monopoly on search, its maps apps (Maps, Waze, Earth) are unrivaled, and it is dominating the classroom with its free online productivity suite of Docs, Sheets, and Slides. Not to mention the fact that YouTube is unrivaled, Google Chrome is unrivaled, and Android is unrivaled when it comes to an iOS alternative. The weaknesses of Google is that they sometimes have no idea what they are doing and fail spectacularly. Google Glass was creepy. Google Plus was lame. Google Nexus went nowhere. And even though Android is breaking record numbers as the world’s most popular OS, Google still clings to their vision of a webpage-centric OS in their flailing ChromeOS. So flailing in fact that they had to suck some energy from Android and make Android apps compatible with ChromeOS.

Amazon is a company I hate with a passion. They abuse their warehouse workers, Jeff Bezos is the richest person on the planet yet he refuses to donate to charity nor conduct interviews except for maybe one by his brother, and this hunger games Amazon is having cities do to impress them for a second headquarters is just messed up and totally fake (Boston is still in the running and they explicitly said they’re offering jack shit with regard to tax breaks). Plus reports are coming in that Whole Foods is being ruined from within: upper management has left, suppliers have left after fees were increased, produce is lagging in quality for the first time, stores are forced to become more centralized and less locally involved, and shelves are deliberately being left empty because of a new system of stocking which may be more efficient but looks awful. Can’t wait for Amazon to fail on this one just like they did with their Fire Phone.

Microsoft is by far the most impressive tech company on this list. Their hardware is top notch, making them safe in an era where companies who make their money on data, like Facebook and Google, are caught in the crosshairs of public perception and backlash. Microsoft’s CEO Satya Nadella is a thoroughly impressive individual who has worked at Microsoft for decades, is humble as well as decisive, and seems to be ready to cut tech that isn’t working for the company while fostering growth and innovation for sectors of the company that have potential or are currently working well. Microsoft Stores are opening up and introducing people to innovative tech straight from the company itself.

In summary I’d say that Microsoft is going to continue to trend upwards, Google’s fate is in their own hands, Apple is not going anywhere better, and Amazon will continue to slide. And when it comes to long term success, I’m more likely to invest in tech companies that do hardware and have a physical presence like their own stores (Microsoft, Apple) than companies who rely totally on reputation (Amazon, Google save for Nest and Pixel).",0.54,0,0.130920198,0.065460099,17-04-2018 08:56,42.10211182,75.1914978,53.57642746,89.42792511,19.17933273

I am not good at evaluating companies but when I look around GOOG is slowly taking over and there is still so much potential growth. 

1). Data - Google has so much data. It is INSANE. They know about billions of humans and their behavior, business, streets, pictures (with google photos) It is absolutely nuts. which brings me to my next two point (AI and Cars)

2). AI - we know that AI is going to be a huge part of our everyday life going forward. And with the amount of data GOOGLE has, they are on the TOP spot to leverage and make their AI the best. This isn't even an opinion right? FB, Microsoft, and Amazon doesn't even have fraction of data that Google has. And AI is all about machine learning, and the more data you feed, smarter it gets. 

3). Automobile- This is uncharted territory, no one has been able to penetrate and challenge the big car giants like GM, Toyota, Audi etc. Once Elon Musk was asked a question, who does he see as his competitor and his answer was Apple. I don't know if he was being ignorant or genuinely don't see Google as a major competitor.    

Google's approach to automobile is same as their approach to Android. They do what they do the best (create software and services) and let the hardware people make the hardware. Seems like they are on the same path with cars, they are creating the best selfdriving system and infrastructure and just going to sell this to other car manufactures, who already know how to build cars. And just like Pixel line up, we might see cars made by Google at some point. But the thing is, how can anyone not see Google as a serious competitor is beyond my understanding. 

I still haven't talked about their new silicon initiative and IoT stuff. Its safe to say, it all looks very promising to me

TSLA,Is Musk getting the Shorts to pay for TSLA going private?,229,314,1533852931,"I think we may be about to witness the greatest financial judo move in recorded history: **Musk will make Tesla private and bury the Shorts, using their own money**. It will not cost him a dime. Detailed explanation below:

Why is this even conceivable? Because Tesla is the most shorted stock ever. There are more shorts to cover than shareholders who would prefer to cash-out at $420.

[Some TSLA data](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/tsla/key-statistics/):

* Shares outstanding: 171M 
* Float: 127M shares, of which:
 * Musk: [34M shares](https://www.nasdaq.com/quotes/insiders/musk-elon-831665)
 * Institutionals: 81M shares.

     Almost all of them (above 70M shares) are not prohibited from holding shares in a private company.
 * Other (incl retail investors): 12M shares.


      Note there aren't enough of those to significantly change the picture.

* Short interest: [35M shares](https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/tsla/short-interest)

Now let's *assume*: 

* This is real. Elon actually has someone willing to buy out any shareholder who doesn't want to, or cannot, go private, at $420.
* Most institutional investors will chose to remain with the privatized Tesla and not exit at $420.
* The board approves, and it goes to a shareholder vote, with a guaranteed 2/3rd majority of Musk and almost all the top institutionals.

What will happen? 

* You have 35M shorts to cover. Less than 35M shares to do that. Nobody will sell for less than the 420 they know they'll get anyway. Result: [Volkswagen-style short squeeze](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-volkswagen/short-sellers-make-vw-the-worlds-priciest-firm-idUSTRE49R3I920081028).
* Anybody who wants out can sell during the short squeeze. 
* If the squeeze goes high enough, some shareholders may change their mind and sell anyway. Probably all the shorts will be covered, but significantly north of 420.
* The only shareholders remaining after the squeeze are those who want to take their stocks into the private stage.

Result: There are no shareholders left that need to be bought out at $420. The short squeeze took care of those. Tesla goes private. Cost to Musk: ZERO.

A classic judo move - use your opponent's momentum against them.

I realize the above scenario sounds insane. But the logic is sound. Even if more institutionals want out, the short squeeze will take care of most of them, and the actual cost of privatization will be a small fraction of TSLA's valuation.

EDIT: I'm back in this thread, and I agree about several of the proposed additions, most notably TIF. A lot of you are asking why I left out SNAP, though. I simply forgot about it, but even if I didn't, it's been public for such a short time that it would screw up any decent backtest, and I would probably not include a company with no history of positive EPS anyways. That said, if any of you put some money into a scheme like this, feel free to add or subtract whatever you want. I am powerless to stop you.

EDIT2: In accordance with community consensus, we can go ahead and add these:

* ETSY

* FIZZ

* GOOS

Watching AAPL drop 25% over the past month had me thinking it was now ""cheap"" and a good deal to start buying but according to this PE [CHART](https://imgur.com/a/RgmmL37) it's stock price to earnings is still near 2-year highs and appears to be above average over the past 8-9 years.   So relative to itself, AAPL does not appear cheap here.  



So then I started thinking, maybe AAPL is cheap relative to the index (Nasdaq) in this case.  Here is a 10 year chart showing AAPL's share price is still up 100% relative the Nasdaq.  [Chart Link](https://imgur.com/a/uO5Ayeh)   Again, AAPL does not yet look cheap.  

&#x200B;

Finally I thought maybe AAPL's PE at around 14 is ""cheap"" relative to all market PEs over the past 30 years.  This [Chart](https://imgur.com/a/RzgqUCU) shows AAPL's PE (red x) relative to S&P500 historic PEs over the past 30 years.   So here AAPL is actually start to look like a good buy as investors are paying less per earnings relative to the market average.  

&#x200B;

To me the first two charts show AAPL as being at least fair or average priced right now relative to itself and the last chart shows it to be at a discount relative to the rest of the market.      Am I doing this right or can anyone offer some insight here.  

  
Thanks.

* * *

Shortly after Apple slashed its revenue guidance for the first quarter, Goldman Sachs said the iPhone maker will likely have to bring down numbers for the full year. As those results drop further, so will the company's shares, the firm said.

""We see the potential for further downside to FY19 numbers depending on the trajectory of Chinese demand in early 2019,"" wrote Goldman's Rod Hall in a note to clients late Wednesday.

The company sees first-quarter revenue of $84 billion vs. a previous guidance of a range of $89 billion and $93 billion. Analysts expected revenue of $91.3 billion for the period, according to the consensus estimate from FactSet. Apple blamed most of the revenue shortfall on a slowing economy in China in the second half.

Apple shares dropped more than 9 percent to $143.70 in premarket trading after ending the first day of 2019 at $157.92. And Goldman's Hall slashed his 12-month forecast to $140 from $182. He also lowered his full-year 2019 revenue estimate by 6 percent to $253 billion and his full-year EPS estimate by 10 percent to $11.66.

Nokia comparison
""We have been flagging China demand issues since late September and Apple's guidance cut confirms our view,"" wrote Hall. ""We do not expect the situation to get better in March and would remain cautious on the region.""

But the analyst went further, comparing Apple to the fallen phone maker Nokia, which became reliant on customer upgrades in the face of a saturated market more than a decade ago. Customers delayed replacing their phones for longer and longer as economy slowed, Goldman notes.

""Nokia saw rapid nexpansion of replacement rates in late 2007 that was well beyond what any linear forecast would have implied,"" wrote Hall. ""Beyond China, we don't see strong evidence of a consumer slowdown heading into 2019 but we just flag to investors that we believe Apple's replacement rates are likely much more sensitive to the macro now that the company is approaching maximum market penetration for the iPhone.""

Goldman got to its new price target by applying just a 12 multiple to the firm's new earnings estimate. Its previous price-earnings ratio was 13.6.",0.94,0,0.064720737,0.032360368,03-01-2019 12:33,33.95254517,75.01399994,50.67854309,91.80425262,20.02400017

AAPL,"QCOM Vs. AAPL settlement. How I lost the opportunity to make $50,000 on a very stupid decision",375,171,1555455592,"Hello Everyone,

&#x200B;

I just needed a place to vent, because I just made the most stupid decision in my life, and I can't really justify it to myself or anyone that I know.

&#x200B;

Back in February, I decided that QCOMs case vs AAPL was putting a lot of pressure on the QCOMs stock price and realized that the options are very cheap considering the opportunity for a favorable outcome.

&#x200B;

I bought 75 April 18 call options with a strike price of 65 for $0.10 each, and till yesterday night I was still holding them.

&#x200B;

I live in Australia, so I am mostly sleeping during US trading hours. Yesterday, however, I woke up at 4 am and decided to put a limit sell order of $0.06 on my options to salvage my losses given that only 2 days are remaining till expiry, and went back to sleep.

&#x200B;

I wake up at 7 am to go to work, and see the news and realize that my options would have been worth a small fortune and the contract is being traded at $6 each which would have realized a 6000% return for me in 2 months.

&#x200B;

Long story short, I lost the opportunity to make $50,000 just because I made a very stupid decision when I woke up at 4 AM! I feel so disgusted with myself and I dont know what to do to feel better. I got everything right but screwed up at the last minute. I feel so angry with myself and having a mental breakdown, and I needed to let someone know what happened.

&#x200B;

How do I live myself and go on with my life after that?

&#x200B;

Edit: Thanks for all of those who offered support and understanding of the situation. I truly understand my mistake, and I know I failed because I never really had a risk and an action plan. It was never about trading for me.

&#x200B;

I started following QCOM back in 2016 and I knew almost everything about the lawsuits and the risks facing the company. In January and February, when the stock fell to the 50s, I started building my thesis and realized the following:

&#x200B;

Telecom Companies started tolling 5G networks.

Phone manufacturers are introducing 5G phones in 2019.

Huwaei and Qualcomm are the global leaders in 5G modems.

Intel is far behind in 5G technology and the sole supplier for AAPL modems.

AAPL cannot really introduce a 5G phone in 2019 if they don't settle with Qualcomm early in the year.

&#x200B;

Given the above, I was almost certain that the settlement will happen, and when I looked into options I knew the risk/return were exceptional so I decided to take a small position. Unfortunately for me, I got the timing just wrong because I haven't planned on rerolling my options and I took action at a time when I wasn't really aware of the complete consequences of selling my position. When I think about it now, I know how stupid that was, just because the option was trading at 0.03 when I put my limit order, and the only reason my order will be executed at 0.06 will be favorable news. If I analyzed that more at the time, I would have realized that putting the order is the worst possible decision. 

&#x200B;

""From: Elon Musk

Date: Wed 5/22/2019 10:45 PM

To: Everybody

As of yesterday, we had over 50,000 net new orders for this quarter. Based on current trends, we have a good chance of exceeding the record 90,700 deliveries of Q4 last year and making this the highest deliveries/sales quarter in Tesla history!

In order to achieve this, we need sustained output of 1,000 Model 3’s per day. Almost all parts of the Model 3 production system have exceeded 1000 units on multiple days (congratulations!!) and we’ve averaged about 900/day this week, so we’re only about 10% away from 7000/week.

If we rally hard, we can do it!

AMZN,AMZN earnings report and the 5th anniversary of me being dumb,194,88,1572006195,"AMZN's missed earnings report from yesterday has me ""reminiscing"" about another missed earnings report, how I squandered a massive opportunity, and how I still haven't learned my lesson.

The year was 2014, and AMZN had been trading in the low-mid 300 range all year after hitting an all-time high of \~400 in January, so it was a bit of a down year.  I don't remember exactly what was going on inside the company at the time, but then, on 23 October 2014, it missed on earnings and the price ""plummeted"" the next day, trading in the 280s/290s.  

On that day, it just so happened that I was kind of stranded in the middle of Camp Pendleton with shyte signal, no computers anywhere nearby, and busy AF running a 75-person detachment on 24 hour operations.  It was only a coincidence that I saw the AMZN news because it had been reported in mainstream media and I got an alert on my phone.  I had been watching the company for a few months and thought to myself, what a great day to buy!  They will certainly recover, this company is solid.   

So I whip out my phone, but I didn't have my brokerage app installed... I've only had a smartphone for two years at this point and still wasn't comfortable putting my financial-related apps on there.  But I said to myself, screw it, you can't miss this opportunity.  So I try downloading the app... but, again, shyte signal... download failed.  Try again... download failed.  I tried this for about an hour until while things were quiet, then everything got busy again and I had to abandon my quest to download the app.  

Next thing I know, market is closed, ahhh damn I missed my chance I say to myself.  I get home from camp Pendleton two weeks later and see that the price has now ""recovered"" to 300+ and I figure, oh well not going to buy it now.  

Yeah, so I know everyone has their ""one that got away"" but hot-damn it's not always so easy to pinpoint the moment in time when it happened.  And I would have held it... I'm a long-term investor.  So yeah, that's my unsolicited sob story.

In any case, I haven't learned my lesson because even though AMZN stock price will plummet again today due to missed earnings, I'm not going to buy it... I'll never be able to decouple my emotions from that stock, I'll just let my ETFs and MFs with AMZN holdings deal with it for now.

https://old.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1k15cb/my_model_of_tsla_through_2013/?st=k5h2987i&sh=78a9694b

Here's the second one I posted a year later with a price target of $800 by end of 2020
https://old.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1yn1kx/my_revised_model_of_tesla_tsla_by_2023/?st=k5h26rti&sh=43f78d64

It appears that my models are running roughly a year behind of where my assumptions are ending up, so I figured I'd share my latest model for your viewing and entertainment pleasure.

In no way am I trying to insinuate that my models are somehow predicting where Tesla's price is going to end up - I'm simply sharing my thought process with you fine folks in the investing community to gather feedback and understand different points of view.

See below model:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GUPfQhpFfax8lYC4iyvYT-gD_i9LIRkngFB_o6MZXA8/edit?usp=sharing

My broad assumptions:

* There will be a 90,000,000 global new vehicle market in 2028
* Roughly 50% of those sales will be electric
* Tesla will capture 17% of the EV market which is roughly 7.6 million cars a year
* I'm assuming a new vehicle introduced in 2025 that will capture the truly affordable car market that will be designed in China and released for worldwide consumption (average of $20k per car without autonomous features). This is called Cybercar in the model
* Autonomous vehicle revenue will begin to kick in around the year 2025
* By 2028, roughly 33% of Tesla's new fleet sales (7.6 * .33 = 2.3m) will be generating some level of revenue for the company as autonomous revenue. For this model I'm assuming $7.3k of sales from autonomous per unit on average at 80% margin
* I'm assuming roughly 1% dilution YoY
* I'm assuming ~300k Tesla operated RoboTaxis manufactured yearly by Tesla to cover gaps in coverage in the self driving network
* I'm assuming Tesla Energy to grow to generate similar levels of sales from the Energy business by 2028 as compared to Auto
* i'm assuming a total operating income % of sales of 17.3% on $508b of revenue by 2028
* I'm assuming a 38 P/E multiple on $87b of yearly earnings by 2028

That covers all the big picture stuff as it pertains to what the model takes into account.

The price is obviously eye popping and would give Tesla a market cap of ~3.5 trillion. However, the way I think about this company is drawing a parallel to Apple, which is a Hardware company that has a SaaS (Software as a Service) component bolted on top of it selling units that generate vastly more $ per unit sold, and is entering an entirely disrupted market in the last 100 years that is about as large as it gets on the auto side - and then you add energy on top of it.

Let me know your thoughts.

I realize that this journal entry got a bit lengthy, so I chopped it into three parts, plus a very hand-wavy speculative conclusion part.

----     
The Pump  
-----     

Mid-January 2020, articles begin pumping TSLA as Musk announces share purchases.    
    
_Markets Insider -  Tesla short sellers have lost nearly $12 billion in just 7 weeks_     
     
_Markets Insider - Tesla has yet another biggest bull on Wall Street. Here's why he thinks the stock could surge 57%._    
     
_Electrek - Tesla (TSLA) gets new $800 price target based on its ability to execute_        
     
Musk is no stranger to stock pumping. Last year he advertised a private share price of 420$, ""funding secured"", to draw in investors. It is not surprising that this time the company (or another party) has turned to media outlets to get article placement from a third party. It is frowned-upon, but not uncommon, for companies to pay journalists, through brokers, to place articles in major publications.   

At the same time, mid-January, coordinated social media and message board posts appeared hyping TSLA and urging users to buy stock. Social media posts appeared on reddit, twitter, facebook about the price of Tesla on trajectory for $1000/share. Many influential users were caught in the frenzy and spread the word. A reddit and twitter user named /u/WSBgod began buying calls in TSLA at $600+; posting his positions and urging his large follower base to do the same. Many of these social media posts were well-written, edgy and bear the hallmarks of professional  copywriters.    

----    
The Dump    
----   
Tesla price began to rise. Viral social media posts and positive articles created high demand for TSLA stock, driving retail investors into a frenzy. On some message boards, users were seen urging people to take credit card advances or student loans to buy Tesla stock at $600+.   

At this point, a short-term ""spike"" in Teslas price occured. For the purposes of discussion, we will consider $767 (the stock issue price, discussed below) at market close to be the defining price of the spike.   

This spike began on 02/03 and ended on 02/26. The stock market was open 18 days  during this window. More remarkably, the closing price of TSLA was only above $767 per share on *12 days* during the window.   
**Chart of the 767$ price line and the recent spike**:   
https://gfycat.com/quaintslimyeuropeanpolecat   

It turns out this short stock market spike was no surprise to Tesla. Tesla and Goldman Sachs were already preparing to issue stock during this narrow period. Tesla filed an 8-K on 02/19 to issue  2.65 million new shares at $767 per share. Teslas/Goldman's  ""luck"" allowed them to issue on one of the top ten highest dates in TSLA history.    

Social media and message board influencers sold dreams of $1500 ""moon"" prices to middle-class retail investors. Many of his new investors were young; drawn by the new mobile-based, zero-commision brokers such as Robinhood. These younger investors typically turn to social media for their stock research. 

Many new and inexperienced investors are unfamiliar with stock ""dilution"" (the concept that issuing new stock devalues existing shareholders). Some shareholders even took to message boards to praise Tesla/Goldman for issuing more shares. Tesla raked in $2.31 billion of that cash advance, student loan, and summer job money during this short period of time, by issuing new shares at the $767 price.    

While the stock issue was happening, insiders began exercising options and dumping their stock. There is nothing intrinsically wrong with insiders selling stock. However  they were *very lucky* that this period happened mid-February - directly in-between earnings calls. This is one of the few timeframes outside of their blackout dates (blackout dates tend to cover most dates in the year for executives, particularly around earnings).

Five insiders can be seen exercising (buying) options and dumping stock during the narrow 18-day February spike time frame. Amidst the insider sales there is only one insider purchase - a well-publicized stock purchase by Elon Musk himself.     

https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/TSLA/insider-trades/    

----     
The wreckage settles     
----     

After the dump finished, the retail investor money was safely in the hands of insiders and Teslas cash reserves. Nameless large traders (known as ""whales"") began dumping the shares in high-volume batches, reaping the final harvest of the inflated stock price. Coincidentally, Covid-19 caused a general decrease in stock prices on the NYSE. The stock price plummeted. TSLA is now hovering around ~$400/share on 03/18, less than half the price of the all-time high where retail investors were paying upwards of $800-900 per share.    

Tesla is now $2.31 billion richer (although Tesla's high cash burn rate will incinerate this money within two quarters). Insiders at Tesla have gained hundreds of millions from their timely exit.    

On twitter and message boards, many users are depressed and downtrodden. The investment they purchased during the flurry of hype has lost its value. Many of the users who bought TSLA now joke about suicide or selling their house. Many users who got caught in the Tesla hype are silent - ashamed of their losses. Many are selling their devalued shares at a huge loss and will not return to invest in stocks for the time being.      

-----   
The other kind of speculation   
----    
Stock frenzys are not a new phenomenon. We can blame the media for the unrealistic moonshot expectations towards TSLA during the hype period.     
    
Yet, it is tough not to look at the timing of the entire event and squint:    
* The company orchestrated one of its largest stock issues during a very narrow 12 day market peak window -  a masterstroke in perfect timing and preparation     
* The media blitz ""pump"" occurred despite Teslas high debt load and extremely low car production rate (400k/year).     
* Institutional investors stayed put and let retail investors run in to the slaughter, chasing promises of $1000+ TSLA    
* Tesla insiders dumped their stock during this period       
    
Sadly, the SEC has been in a deep slumber for the past two decades. With the tech industry oligopolies running amok; plus thousands of pump-and-dumps that could only be orchestrated in a now socially-interconnected world, we need their enforcement now more than ever.     
    
Maybe there is some mythical horn we have to blow to rouse the SEC from its slumber. Until then, we can only look at incidents like this and squint at the happenstance. I hope that people far smarter and better researched than myself will look into the Tesla spike and verify that everything is above-board.    
     
""Funding secured""

-----
Edit: Counterpoints
-----

There are a few aspects of this situation that go against my hypothesis that the price was pumped.

* The dump occurred during the Covid-19 outbreak. It is difficult to seperate market manipulation from the general downturn during this period   
* Tesla insiders still hold a large portion of TSLA stock   
* Musk himself purchased stock during the spike. (This is a good point, although I don't believe the stock purchase represents a major buy, considering Musk's enormous wealth. Teslas survival is a point of personal pride to Musk. He has been known to play dirty when his reputation is threatened - he once hired a private investigator to dig up dirt on a dive instructor from Thailand that snubbed him)
* The price rose due to the short squeeze. (This is a counterargument I generally disagree with. The short interest was orders of magnitude smaller than the purchase volume that drove the price to $900+)",0.83,0.5,0.073674823,0.286837411,18-03-2020 06:06,59.9274559,91.5,54.70565033,134.6573792,24.08133316

MSFT,Sharing my top companies with you.,3026,536,1586536709,"I just finished my watchlist after evaluating 300+ companies. It took me two weeks of full-time reading financials, calculate the maths and look up news around the companies for the last year. You don't have to take anything for granted, I'm not a professional analyst, just a guy with a lot of time and a decent look on financials. I'm not here for credit, I just think it might help some people and since it took a lot of time, it feels like a waste if I didn't share it.

It's a lot of tech, but I feel like it's also the way to go, especially during this crisis. I'm mostly staying away from the financial and real estate, but will invest more when there's a more clear image on the situation later this year. Healthcare, Industrial, Military and Energy are very dependent on political changes, so I'm also careful with those. Anyway, here we go.

**- ALPHABET -A-.** Cash king, enough to pay off all their liabilities easily. Very nice growth over the years, even when they're so big. Most of the times, you see blue chips / market leaders stagnate, but not Google. Advertising will take a hit and there might be restrictions on online privacy in the upcoming years, but they are still very strong armed to take on those setbacks.

**- ARISTA NETWORKS.** Same as Google, very strong financials, growth and cash position. Only negative, is that they had a growth setback in Q4 of last year, but nothing indicates it's gonna keep on decaying. They will keep on gaining market cap from Cisco. Very innovative management team with experience in networking. They create high performance cloud networks for big datacenters. Microsoft and Facebook are some of their biggest clients.

**- FACEBOOK.** This is double, I feel like next two years is a make or break for Facebook. On one hand, they still need to improve a lot on AI and control on fake news. They had (and probably still have) privacy issues as well and they will lose a lot of advertising revenue this year. On the other hand, Facebook is expanding a lot to different parts of tech. They have Oculus coming out for VR and they just started with FB Gaming. It's also not only Facebook, but they own WhatsApp and Instagram as well. To me, those are great companies at the moment and have an insane amount of users. Their growth over the past 5 years was close to 300% and they are also cash heavy.

**- GALAPAGOS.** To give you some numbers: in comparison to 2017, they increased revenue by 469%, while expenses only increased by 111%. In comparison to 2015, numbers are 1391% and 253%. Their cash position is double the total liabilities and 10 times their expenses in 2019. You might say they're very ready to take on this crisis. On the operational side, they have multiple medicines in later trial phases and they're backed by biotech giant Gilead Sciences.

**- INCYTE GENOMICS.** Another biotech company with great financials. They even reduced expenses since 2017, while they generated 40% more revenue. This year, 25% more hedgefunds have bought into Incyte, making it a total of 46 hedgefunds who own shares in this company. There is also 17,10% of the company owned by insiders, which shows they strongly believe in their company as well. The average insider percentage of all companies in my watchlist will be 6-8%

**- LULULEMON ATHLETICA.** Steady growth. Cult-like following with their fitness programs. It's a real millennial staple. Very strategic store openings as well. I see a lot of growth potential, especially when they can get some celebrity athletes to wear their clothing. That will make their young and hip image even bigger. Quality wise, they are way better than giants like Nike and Under Armour, which will also result in better image and growing customer fanbase.

**- MASTERCARD.** Very big profit margins (57% last year). One of the least best on financials in this list, but indispensable with a heavy growing e-commerce. Some might rather look at Visa, but I feel like Mastercard is more innovative. They invested in AI-powered authentication and cybersecurity. They are also more used by fintech companies, which is a sector that also will only grow the next 5-10 years.

**- MICROSOFT.** No brainer. Biggest company in the world. Since their new CEO, they're headed definitely in the right direction. Microsoft changed focus from hardware to cloud computing. The cloud services are still in their early year, I see an enormous growth potential. Also very big usage of Teams. It's a personal opinion, but with those quarantine restrictions, I feel like a lot of companies will realize letting their employees work from home has a lot of financial advantages, which will result in sale of more virtual working devices.

**- NVIDIA.** Market leader on semiconductors, making chips that process AI mathematic operations. They didn't grow that much in the last 3 years, but they are very cash heavy and ready to invest in the future. They are invested in all the big things for the future. Cloud, data, AI, gaming,... Some say GPU's are the best investment for the next 5, 10, 25 years, since you will find them in literally everything. For example, it will become an essential part of self-driving cars.

**- VEEVA SYSTEMS.** One of the youngest company in this list, specialized in cloud computing in the pharmaceutical and life sciences industry. Best of both world if you ask me. It's revenue is mostly based on subscriptions, so there are almost no surprised there. That's also the main reason why this stock is so expensive. They have beaten revenue expectations for 20 quarters in a row now. Innovative CEO, who will keep on searching to diversify and growing, getting more into data and programmatic advertising. Financial wise, they also have enough cash to pay off all their liabilities and to get through at least one year without any income.

One last thing: These companies are picked based on financials and future outlook, I didn't take value into account. I know companies like Lululemon Athletica and Veeva Systems are expensive, quite overvalued. I'm not buying into them right now, but maybe in the future.

Hope it helped at least one of you out there, enjoy the Easter weekend!

Ask yourself this. The next time you log into work, at the office or virtually, what are you logging into? What behind the scenes is authenticating and controlling your network access levels throughout the company network? How is the company segmenting data to make sure specific end users can only access specific data sets like payroll, HR, and other sensitive personal identifiable information?

GOOG,"1,5 Years Since My Journey Began, $52 591 dollars wealthier & only 18 months left.",1833,277,1593553376,"*Introduction*

I'm 20 years old and my interest for the stock market began at age 16 which later grew into becoming my lovely addiction and before graduating high school i already had a detailed plan on how i would become financial independent and self employed as quick as possible, the first milestone to reach before continuing my dreams are to reach an entire net worth of $100 000 dollars.

In the beginning of setting the $100 000 dollar goal i started with $13 953 dollars and today 1,5 years later i have a total net worth of $66 544 dollars which basically means i only have 33,45% left of the goal to complete within 18 months which is entirely possible. It felt so much harder in the beginning but hard work pays off. While creating the plan i expected to have $52 730 dollars this month of the year but from making better decisions, working hard and presumably a little touch of luck i'm 5 months ahead.

I maximized the overtime-limit at my workplace last year which is roughly 200 hours per year, i managed to reach 212h, sadly the overtime is cancelled due to covid-19 but currently i have 24h 36m in overtime. I've driven taxi *(illegally which i stopped doing)*, been cutting lawns an lending out money in order to speed up the process of my journey.

I've cut almost all unnecessary expenses, i don't travel, i rarely drink alcohol, still driving around in my $1 000 dollar car watching others laugh at me but don't get me wrong, i enjoy traveling and eventfully i'm going to buy myself a new car, i don't want to create wealth just to stare at it. This is something i been planning for a very long time and that i'm fully committed to. It's psychologically frustrating but in the end it's definitely going to be worth it.

note: *The Tickers with bold fonts are swedish stocks/funds which may not be available in your country.*

I sold a majority of my shares in the beginning of 2020 expecting a recession or correction but instead we got covid-19 which was extremely unpredictable so i was really lucky that i already had a pretty high amount in liquidity. So far i've been taking advantage of the pandemic by investing in stocks that i hopefully believe will recover. I also did some Q1 report trading which made me about $3 000 dollars profit, i traded CAST, GOOG, TWTR and I'm constantly looking for opportunities.

I'm expected to be fully invested within 1 year and i'm not stressed by having 55,93% liquidity since the inflation is 0. The *""fear of missing out""* is also nothing that's bothering me, everything can happen, especially now.

*Income, expenses & conditions*

My monthly income varies depending on how much i work but i averaged $3 008 dollars after taxes during 2019, i invest everything except $500 dollars and the reason how i can invest 83,37% of my monthly income is because i still live at home. The only reason why i still live at home is so i can take advantage of the opportunity to invest and build myself a foundation.

AAPL,$AAPL - iOS14 changes could cut app ad monetization by 50%,162,42,1594072395,"When Apple rolls out iOS14 (likely in September), any app/developer who wants access to the Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA) for an Apple device will need to get user consent again.

That consent is stored and only reset if user uninstall/reinstall the app, so the app can't just keep prompting for user for consent over and over. Also, AAPL will control the language/presentation of the consent prompt, although developers should still have some options around how to minimize opt-outs (e.g. degrading app experience until user accepts tracking).

A poll by Ad Profs (an independent ad tech consultancy) in Sep 2019 suggests \~80% of those surveyed had expected some major change to IDFA within a year. They estimate 1/2 of iOS users will upgrade to iOS14 within a few weeks of rollout, and above 90% of users will have upgraded by Q1 of 2021.

Ad Profs also estimate the iOS14 upgrade will result in \~50% cut to app ad monetization.

Having said that, Jefferies is not expecting a V-shaped recovery in ad demand, and estimate Q2 average ad revenue -2% y/y (vs Street -5%), followed by rebound in Q3 (+9% vs Street +3%) and Q4 (+18% vs Street +11%).

Morgan Stanley sees Apple beating expectations at July 30 earnings call

AMZN,"$AMZN - analysts expect Thursday's Q2 to beat on revenue, but less optimistic about margins",123,67,1596032346,"**Goldman**: *""We expect Amazon to report results well above consensus expectations on revenue and profitability (Exhibit 1), given stronger than expected performance across all businesses, particularly NA Retail. We expect 3Q guidance to fall above consensus on a revenue basis and inline/below on operating income as the company accelerates infrastructure investments to accommodate sustained growth in customer demand and avoid showing outsized profitability during the current crisis. The net increase in demand across all segments of Amazon’s business and Amazon’s ability to meet the challenges of this demand is, we believe, serving to steepen the curve of its long term growth rate, drive incremental profitability, and further deepen its competitive moats. While the stock has outperformed the majority of Internet significantly YTD, we believe the market continues to underestimate the long-term value of the Amazon platform as the leader in both the movement of retail online and compute into the cloud, the realization of which is being accelerated by the current crisis. Therefore, we continue to believe Amazon represents the best risk/reward in the Internet sector and remain Buy-rated (CL) with a $3,800 12-month price target.""*

**Jefferies**: *""Expectations are high heading into Q2 results on Thursday, w/ AMZN up 65% YTD and 34% since Q1. We expect AMZN to deliver, but prefer to focus on how recent changes in consumer behavior provide attractive long-term opportunities given most of the nearterm acceleration is priced in. We would also point to attractive valuation despite the YTD move, w/ current 28x NTM EV/EBITDA standing roughly in-line w/ 2017-18 despite a larger mix of high margin businesses.""*

**Barclays**: *""Buyside expectations for Retail revenue growth ex-FX are likely in the range of +40% Y/Y (vs. consensus +29%) and AWS “low 30%’s” Y/Y (vs. consensus +32%), and we expect largely in-line results. We also expect guidance to reflect some normalization in growth in late 3Q, similar to what the company guided 90 days ago, but also factoring in the shift in Prime Day to 4Q. There are few companies better positioned for the current environment than Amazon. Prime members rely on Amazon more than ever for essential and discretionary purchases, and few retailers have earned the trust and reliability that Amazon enjoys. Disruption with global supply chains, store closures, and Covid-fear among consumers has created a perfect storm whereby there seem to be few places other than Amazon where one can receive goods reliably and on time across 100m+ SKUs. The question we ask ourselves constantly is: how much longer can this dynamic play out, and what happens when growth trends normalize? June came and went without much deceleration for Amazon or ecommerce as a whole, despite economies re-opening (behavior appears to have changed semi-permanently in terms of the shift away from brick-and-mortar). At 20x 2021 EBITDA, the same level we were at before Covid, the risk/reward remains attractive.""*

**Telsey**: *"" We are raising our sales forecast for 2Q20 (up \~1% to \~29% to $81.6B) and 2020 (up \~1% to \~25% to $349.5B), given our view that Amazon has been seeing strong demand of both essentials and discretionary products. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the shift to online, which combined with US Government stimulus checks, temporary retail store closures, and ongoing retail consolidation, should generate solid results. In addition, the usage of advertising, music, movies, and gaming subscriptions is on the rise. Amazon Web Services (AWS) also should see sales accelerate, given the shift to cloud computing and remote offices/classrooms. That said, we are lowering our 2Q20 and 2020 profit forecasts due to incremental costs (including over $4B in 2020) related to COVID-19—unfavorable product mix, productivity headwinds from social distancing, investment in personal protective equipment, and higher wages and logistic costs, including faster delivery.""*

**Canaccord Genuity**: *"" We forecast \~27% y/y total revenue growth for Amazon in Q2 as the company likely saw accelerating growth for its online stores as a result of heightened eCommerce demand during the pandemic. We expect operating margin to be around breakeven, as management plans to reinvest virtually all of its Q2 operating profit into COVID-19-related safety initiatives and to ensure fulfillment efficiency. Amazon will also likely provide an update on recent trends for AWS.""*",0.92,-0.166666667,0.125789242,-0.020438713,29-07-2020 14:19,92.60829926,151.6764984,75.91456604,196.2586212,99.9406662

Post-COVID bounce, I wanted to see how these picks have performed, so I've gathered them all here.

A few of these have earnings posting soon, so the ranks may change, but overall it looks like a solid performance by the community.  Any new underrated stocks to think about?  

&nbsp;

# Some quick stats:

- Overall average return: ~33% (compared to ~18% for the S&P 500)

- Equal rated return: ~50% (as pointed out by /u/csp256)

- Return on the most upvoted pick: Disney (DIS) 1%

- Highest returning pick: Enphase (ENPH) 1110% (recommended by /u/williemax)

- If you invested in the top 5 most upvoted stocks, you would have seen a 27% return

- If you invested in the top 5 most controversial stocks, you would have seen a 99% return

- The top 10 gainers in order were ENPH, TSLA, APT, DXCM, OKTA, AYX, BAND, ALU, WIX, LRCX

- If you had picked one of these stocks at random, you would have had a ~53% chance of >10% gains and a ~19% chance of >100% gains

AAPL,The underrated stock survey! Submit your picks for the community to track,773,715,1596443977,"Following on the previous tracking post ([http://redd.it/i2mmzg](http://redd.it/i2mmzg))  and the highly upvoted request from /u/DJ-Ascii , I've set up this post for another round of underrated or undervalued stock picks.

As before, let us know what stock you believe is underrated and a consistent winner that has done well for you, or you believe will do well going forward.

In order to make this easier to track please use the following guidelines for submitting.

1. Only one submission per comment. You can make multiple comments, but please only submit one stock per comment.
2. Please include at least the ticker and the company name. Feel free to explain why you think this is a good stock.

I'll add these new picks alongside the old survey so as to update you on each portfolio over time.  Don't worry about any overlaps.

Edit 1: I've compiled everyone who has posted so far, but I'll look out for any final additions tomorrow.  The list will then be locked EOD on Friday the 7th of August, and all prices will start from there.

Edit 2: All picks have now been locked down and consolidated into the list below.  Stocks are sorted in alphabetical order of their company name and the ID corresponds to the approximate order in which they were submitted.  The next update will be in 30 days.

MSFT,The underrated stock survey! Submit your picks for the community to track,771,715,1596443977,"Following on the previous tracking post ([http://redd.it/i2mmzg](http://redd.it/i2mmzg))  and the highly upvoted request from /u/DJ-Ascii , I've set up this post for another round of underrated or undervalued stock picks.

As before, let us know what stock you believe is underrated and a consistent winner that has done well for you, or you believe will do well going forward.

In order to make this easier to track please use the following guidelines for submitting.

1. Only one submission per comment. You can make multiple comments, but please only submit one stock per comment.
2. Please include at least the ticker and the company name. Feel free to explain why you think this is a good stock.

I'll add these new picks alongside the old survey so as to update you on each portfolio over time.  Don't worry about any overlaps.

Edit 1: I've compiled everyone who has posted so far, but I'll look out for any final additions tomorrow.  The list will then be locked EOD on Friday the 7th of August, and all prices will start from there.

Edit 2: All picks have now been locked down and consolidated into the list below.  Stocks are sorted in alphabetical order of their company name and the ID corresponds to the approximate order in which they were submitted.  The next update will be in 30 days.

AAPL,Buy AAPL in front of 4:1 stock split. Stock splits add 8% in first year following split.,1651,377,1596815890,"Critics argue that stock splits are non-events, that splitting a $400 stock 4:1 results in 4 shares trading at $100 each. Research shows splits add value. An Aug 2003 study at the Univ Illinois found that stocks that split beat the market by 8% in Yr 1, and by 12% in Yr 3. 

Why do stock splits work?
- Draws attention to the stock’s past success (momentum)
- Tend to be followed by increased earnings and dividends (signaling)
- Attracts new investors who couldn’t afford (broadens base)

GOOG,GOOG vs AAPL? Which do you prefer longterm?,25,58,1597256241,"Been thinking of whether I should trim my apple or google positions and honestly...feeling kinda bearish on Google.

Google has been lagging QQQ for a while now. I guess partly due to the ad cutting due to corona. But it also seems like their ad revenue growth has been decelerating for other reasons with a lot of players attacking the space from different angles (Amzn,TTD, Roku, FB, ramp etc).

 Their company culture is heavily based around engineering yet not so savvy when it comes to product marketing and expanding shareholder value. They come up with cool tech but seem to always be either too late or too early to the party. Google glasses didn't pan out, pixel phones are a modest success but not taking the industry by storm, google shopping is a money sink, Google fiber was curtailed, Fitbit acquisition is kind of iffy (Samsung/Garmin/Apple already dominate the space across respective demographics). They keep selling the AI future but Waymo seems to be the only thing they have going here that can turn out to be truly profitable. Will that be enough though?

Apple on the other hand knows how to drive share price. Always doing buybacks. Although they are historically a hardware focused company they are transitioning more and more into the services industry with their popular app store, Apple TV+, apple pay etc. Seems like this will be their long-term pivot. And road ahead seems more clearer to me than Google's. 


Seems like AAPL just has more growth opportunities left in it and has superior company culture. Google seems to be transitioning to more of a value stock. What are your thoughts?",0.89,0,0.140384615,0.070192308,12-08-2020 18:17,110.3170776,158.1119995,75.14645386,201.1925049,103.6506653

AAPL,Apple becomes first U.S. company to reach a $2 trillion market cap,2879,500,1597848859,">Apple hit a market cap of $2 trillion, doubling in valuation in just over two years. It’s the first publicly traded U.S. company to reach the $2 trillion milestone. 

>Apple first reached a $1 trillion market cap on Aug. 2, 2018. Wall Street has largely expected Apple to be the first to surpass the $2 trillion mark. On July 31, Apple surpassed the state oil giant Saudi Aramco to become the world’s most valuable publicly traded company.

#High level advice:
=========================================

I picked the 7 I agree with.

1. Invest in what you know…and nothing more.
2. Never compromise on business quality
3. When you buy a stock, plan to hold it forever
4. Diversification can be dangerous
5. Most news is noise, not news (don't read articles about investing)
8. The best moves are usually boring (buy and hold)
10. Only listen to those you know and trust 

I firmly believe that anyone who follows those concepts, they will find success in investing.  

#General mindset:
================
- Keep emotions out of the market
- Don't bother timing the market. Don't get ruled by FOMO.
- Understand that for some stocks, you can't really average cost down. You will have to stomach buying the stock at a higher entry point. My refusal to average up early on caused me to miss out on a lot of gains. 
- Understand the difference between trading, investing, and gambling. 
- Have an exit strategy (stop losses would have helped me a lot in March, I now learned from my expensive mistake)
- Be greedy-- not TOO greedy. If a stock pops 10%, I will sell half to lock in profits. It's super common to see a lot of companies pop and the next day dip a bit due to sell off. Perfect time to grab more on the dip. This is obviously impossible to time, which is why I only sell half. 

#Application:
==================================================================
I was very specific in the types of companies I would choose to invest in within tech. I decided to follow my strengths. As a data engineer, I'm very intimate with cloud technologies, and I think I generally have pretty sharp business acumen and good strategic direction. 

As a result, my day to day work had me using a ton of technologies in the cloud space. I've used Splunk, NewRelic, Twilio, AWS, GCP, Hortonworks/Cloudera, Oracle, Tableau, Datadog, Sendgrid (bought by Twilio), Dropbox/box, Slack, Salesforce, Marketo, Databricks, Snowflake, HP Vertica, just to name a few. I was familiar with CDN services like Fastly and Cloudflare because sometimes, I worked with the DevOps and IT guys. 

Based on industry hearsay, day to day work, eventually, I got a good ""feel"" of what technologies were widely adopted, easy to use, and had a good reputation in the industry. Similarly, I also got a feel for what tech were being considered 'dated' or not widely used (HP, Oracle, Cloudera, Dropbox, Box). 

I tend to shy away from companies that I don't understand. In the past, most times I've done that-- I got burned.  My biggest losers this year was betting on $NAT and $JMNA (10k total loss). After learning from those mistakes, I decided to only focus on investing in companies that either I or my peers have intimate first hand experience with using. Because of this rationale, the majority of stocks in my portfolio are products which I believe in, I thoroughly enjoy using, and I would recommend to my friends, family, and colleagues. 

Post COVID, due to the shift to remote work and increase in online shopping I decided to double down on tech. I already knew that eCommerce was the next big thing. I made very early investments into SHOP and Amazon in 2017 for that reason.

My hypothesis was that post-COVID, the shift on increased online activity, remote work, and eCommerce would mean that companies which build tools to support increased online activity should also increase. I decided to choose three sectors within tech to narrow down-- these were three sectors that I had a good understanding of, due to the nature of my work and personal habits. 

1. eCommerce + AdTech 
2. IT/DevOps (increased online activity means higher need for infra)
3. FinTech (increased shopping activity means more transactions)

These are the points I consider before I consider jumping into a stock:

1. Do I feel good about using the company? Do I believe in the company's vision?
2. Where do I see this company in 5 years? 10 years? Do I see my potential children being around to use these companies?
3. What does YoY, QoQ growth look like for this company? 
4. Is/Will this product be a core part of how businesses or people operate?
5. Who are their customers and target demographic?
6. (SaaS) Customer testimonials, white papers, case studies. If it's for a technology, I'm going to want to read a paper or use case.

In March, I took what I believe to be an ""educated gamble"". When the market crashed, I liquefied most of my non tech assets and reinvested them into tech. Some of the holdings I already had, some holdings were newly purchased.

*EDIT* ^^^ this isn't called timing the market you /r/wsb imbeciles. Timing the market would be trying to figure out when to PULL OUT during ATH and then buying the dip. I SOLD at the lowest point, and I with the cash I sold AT A LOSS, I reinvested that cash and doubled down into tech. If I sold in Feb, and bought back in March, that would be calling timing the market. What I am doing is called REINVESTING/REBALANCING... not timing the market. 

I have 50% of my networth in AMZN, MSFT, AAPL, GOOG, FB, NFLX, and the rest in individual securities/mutual funds. I have 3 shares of TSLA that I got in @1.5.

Here are the non FAANGs I chose.

1. $SQ. I had already been invested in SQ since 2016. I made several bad trades, holding when it first blew past 90 until I sold it at 70... bought in again last year at 60s, after noticing that more and more B&M stores were getting rid of their clunky POS systems and replacing it with Square's physical readers. After COVID, I noticed a lot of pop up vendors, restaurants doing take out. A Square reader made transactions very easy to make post-COVID. 

2. $ATVI. Call of Duty and Candy Crush print money for them. I've been a Blizzard fanboy since I was a kid, so I have to keep this just out of principle.

3. $SHOP. They turned a profit this year, and I think there is still a lot more room to grow. It's become somewhat of a household name. I've met quite a few people who mentioned that they have a Shopify site set up to do their side hustle. I've tried the product myself, and can definitely attest that it's pretty easy to get an online shop up and running within a day. I 5.5xed my return here. 

4. $BIGC. I bought into this shortly after IPO. I'm very excited to see an American Shopify. BigC focuses on enterprise customers right now, and Shopify independent merchants, so I don't see them directly competing. I'm self aware this is essentially a gamble. I got in at 90, sold at 140, and added more in 120s. I def got lucky here... it's not common for IPOs to pop so suddenly. I honestly wasn't expecting it to pop so soon.

5. $OKTA. Best in class SSO tool. Amazing tool that keeps tracks of all of my sign-ons at work. 

6. $DDOG. Great monitoring tool. Widely adopted and good recommendations throughout the industry. Always had a nice looking booth at GoogleNext.

7. $ZM. Zoom was the only video conf tool at work which I had a good time using. Adoption had blown up pre-COVID already in the tech world, and post-COVID, they somehow became a noun. ""Zoom parties"" and ""Zoom dates"" somehow became a thing interwoven into peoples' day to day lives.

8. $TWLO. Twilio sells APIs which allow applications to send messages like text, voice, and video chat. For example, when DoorDash sends you a text at 1 AM reminding you that your bad decision has arrived, that text is powered by Twilio. In March, New York announced that they were going to use Twilio to send SMS notifs for COVID contact tracing. 

10. $NET/$FSTY. These two two seem like the ones best poised for growth in the CDN space. This is based off of industry exposure and chatting with people who work in DevOps.

11. $DOCU. people aren't going to office to sign stuff, super easy to use, I like their product. 

12. $WMT. eComm, streaming, and a very substantial engineering investment makes me think they have room to grow. Also I really need to diversify. 

13. $COST. When is the last time you heard someone say ""Man I hate going to Costco and paying $1.50 for a hotdog and soda?"" Diversification. Also cheap hotdogs.

14. $NVDA/AMD. GPUs are the present and the future. Not only are they used for video games, but Machine Learning now uses GPU instead of CPU to do compute (Tensorflow for example). Crypto is still a thing as well, and there will always been a constant need for GPUs.

Mutual funds/ETFs
1. $FSCSX. MF which focuses on FinTech. 

2. $VTSAX Pretty much moves with the SP500. 

3. $WCLD. Holdings include Salesforce, Workday, Zuora, Atlassian, Okta, New Relic, Fastly... 

Titanvest:
I was an early access user, and I was able to secure 0% fees for my accout. 36% gains so far. I like them, because their portfolio happens to include shares of tech giants that I either don't have individual stocks for or my stake is low (CRM, PPYL). It nicely complements my existing portfolio.

#Some things I do that that are against the grain:

- Not really diversified. 80% is in tech. They are in very different sectors of tech, but the truth is, when tech falls, all of these companies fall. I'm obviously long tech and I do not believe that tech will fall anytime soon. What about the dot com bubble? There wasn't a single dot com company that was integral in our lives. The internet was in its infancy then. Techonology is now such an interwoven part of our lives and I see companies like Apple, Amazon, Google to be sticking around for several generations.

- I don't read investing articles. I think people who write articles about a stock all have ulterior motives-- to pump or to dump. Case in point-- Citron Research spent years writing articles telling people how SHOP was overvalued. Why did they do that? Because they were shorters at the time. I turned 5k into 27k, because I held on to most of my SHOP shares.

- I don't take much value from balance sheets, other than net loss, income, YoY growth. Instead, I use my business acumen to try to pick up on info that isn't super apparent from Google. For example, one thing I always do is that I look at the career page to see how the business is growing. Increase on marketing/sales/implementation engineers is typically a solid sign that a company is preparing headcount to take new deals in the upcoming quarters. I look at the product road map, supported integrations, and customer base. 

One example was how I applied the above principle was to WalMart. In 2018 I noticed that I was getting targeted by a lot of Data engineering job listing for WalMartLabs-- WarMart's tech division. The role was to build out a big data pipeline to support their eCommerce platform. WalMart's online store released in Q3 of 2019. Post COVID, I used their online store and it was a seamless experience. They even offer a 5% cash back card like Amazon. They reported strong Q4 sales last year, and they did very well post COVID. Why did I choose to invest in $WMT? Because I believe that Wal-Mart has room to grow for their online platform. 

Lastly... remember that wealth isn't accrued over time. It takes years to build. The quickest way to increase your wealth is by investing in yourself-- your career and earning potential. The sooner my income increased, the quicker I had more capital to buy into stocks. 

Also, if you've gotten this far, the point of my post isn't to say that you should invest into tech. The message I'm trying to get across is-- when picking companies, pick companies in fields or verticals you have good knowledge in. Heed Buffet's advice to only pick companies you believe in and understand. Play to your strengths, don't mindless toss money based on one person's posts on Reddit-- always do your own due diligence. Use DD as a guide and use personal research and experience to drive your decision.",0.84,0.6,0.124371451,0.362185725,28-08-2020 01:58,121.8334351,170.0899963,82.01906586,220.6907806,147.5599976

I tend to shy away from companies that I don't understand. In the past, most times I've done that-- I got burned.  My biggest losers this year was betting on $NAT and $JMNA (10k total loss). After learning from those mistakes, I decided to only focus on investing in companies that either I or my peers have intimate first hand experience with using. Because of this rationale, the majority of stocks in my portfolio are products which I believe in, I thoroughly enjoy using, and I would recommend to my friends, family, and colleagues. 

Post COVID, due to the shift to remote work and increase in online shopping I decided to double down on tech. I already knew that eCommerce was the next big thing. I made very early investments into SHOP and Amazon in 2017 for that reason.

My hypothesis was that post-COVID, the shift on increased online activity, remote work, and eCommerce would mean that companies which build tools to support increased online activity should also increase. I decided to choose three sectors within tech to narrow down-- these were three sectors that I had a good understanding of, due to the nature of my work and personal habits. 

1. eCommerce + AdTech 
2. IT/DevOps (increased online activity means higher need for infra)
3. FinTech (increased shopping activity means more transactions)

These are the points I consider before I consider jumping into a stock:

1. Do I feel good about using the company? Do I believe in the company's vision?
2. Where do I see this company in 5 years? 10 years? Do I see my potential children being around to use these companies?
3. What does YoY, QoQ growth look like for this company? 
4. Is/Will this product be a core part of how businesses or people operate?
5. Who are their customers and target demographic?
6. (SaaS) Customer testimonials, white papers, case studies. If it's for a technology, I'm going to want to read a paper or use case.

In March, I took what I believe to be an ""educated gamble"". When the market crashed, I liquefied most of my non tech assets and reinvested them into tech. Some of the holdings I already had, some holdings were newly purchased.

*EDIT* ^^^ this isn't called timing the market you /r/wsb imbeciles. Timing the market would be trying to figure out when to PULL OUT during ATH and then buying the dip. I SOLD at the lowest point, and I with the cash I sold AT A LOSS, I reinvested that cash and doubled down into tech. If I sold in Feb, and bought back in March, that would be calling timing the market. What I am doing is called REINVESTING/REBALANCING... not timing the market. 

I have 50% of my networth in AMZN, MSFT, AAPL, GOOG, FB, NFLX, and the rest in individual securities/mutual funds. I have 3 shares of TSLA that I got in @1.5.

Here are the non FAANGs I chose.

1. $SQ. I had already been invested in SQ since 2016. I made several bad trades, holding when it first blew past 90 until I sold it at 70... bought in again last year at 60s, after noticing that more and more B&M stores were getting rid of their clunky POS systems and replacing it with Square's physical readers. After COVID, I noticed a lot of pop up vendors, restaurants doing take out. A Square reader made transactions very easy to make post-COVID. 

2. $ATVI. Call of Duty and Candy Crush print money for them. I've been a Blizzard fanboy since I was a kid, so I have to keep this just out of principle.

3. $SHOP. They turned a profit this year, and I think there is still a lot more room to grow. It's become somewhat of a household name. I've met quite a few people who mentioned that they have a Shopify site set up to do their side hustle. I've tried the product myself, and can definitely attest that it's pretty easy to get an online shop up and running within a day. I 5.5xed my return here. 

4. $BIGC. I bought into this shortly after IPO. I'm very excited to see an American Shopify. BigC focuses on enterprise customers right now, and Shopify independent merchants, so I don't see them directly competing. I'm self aware this is essentially a gamble. I got in at 90, sold at 140, and added more in 120s. I def got lucky here... it's not common for IPOs to pop so suddenly. I honestly wasn't expecting it to pop so soon.

5. $OKTA. Best in class SSO tool. Amazing tool that keeps tracks of all of my sign-ons at work. 

6. $DDOG. Great monitoring tool. Widely adopted and good recommendations throughout the industry. Always had a nice looking booth at GoogleNext.

7. $ZM. Zoom was the only video conf tool at work which I had a good time using. Adoption had blown up pre-COVID already in the tech world, and post-COVID, they somehow became a noun. ""Zoom parties"" and ""Zoom dates"" somehow became a thing interwoven into peoples' day to day lives.

8. $TWLO. Twilio sells APIs which allow applications to send messages like text, voice, and video chat. For example, when DoorDash sends you a text at 1 AM reminding you that your bad decision has arrived, that text is powered by Twilio. In March, New York announced that they were going to use Twilio to send SMS notifs for COVID contact tracing. 

10. $NET/$FSTY. These two two seem like the ones best poised for growth in the CDN space. This is based off of industry exposure and chatting with people who work in DevOps.

11. $DOCU. people aren't going to office to sign stuff, super easy to use, I like their product. 

12. $WMT. eComm, streaming, and a very substantial engineering investment makes me think they have room to grow. Also I really need to diversify. 

13. $COST. When is the last time you heard someone say ""Man I hate going to Costco and paying $1.50 for a hotdog and soda?"" Diversification. Also cheap hotdogs.

14. $NVDA/AMD. GPUs are the present and the future. Not only are they used for video games, but Machine Learning now uses GPU instead of CPU to do compute (Tensorflow for example). Crypto is still a thing as well, and there will always been a constant need for GPUs.

Mutual funds/ETFs
1. $FSCSX. MF which focuses on FinTech. 

2. $VTSAX Pretty much moves with the SP500. 

3. $WCLD. Holdings include Salesforce, Workday, Zuora, Atlassian, Okta, New Relic, Fastly... 

Titanvest:
I was an early access user, and I was able to secure 0% fees for my accout. 36% gains so far. I like them, because their portfolio happens to include shares of tech giants that I either don't have individual stocks for or my stake is low (CRM, PPYL). It nicely complements my existing portfolio.

#Some things I do that that are against the grain:

- Not really diversified. 80% is in tech. They are in very different sectors of tech, but the truth is, when tech falls, all of these companies fall. I'm obviously long tech and I do not believe that tech will fall anytime soon. What about the dot com bubble? There wasn't a single dot com company that was integral in our lives. The internet was in its infancy then. Techonology is now such an interwoven part of our lives and I see companies like Apple, Amazon, Google to be sticking around for several generations.

- I don't read investing articles. I think people who write articles about a stock all have ulterior motives-- to pump or to dump. Case in point-- Citron Research spent years writing articles telling people how SHOP was overvalued. Why did they do that? Because they were shorters at the time. I turned 5k into 27k, because I held on to most of my SHOP shares.

- I don't take much value from balance sheets, other than net loss, income, YoY growth. Instead, I use my business acumen to try to pick up on info that isn't super apparent from Google. For example, one thing I always do is that I look at the career page to see how the business is growing. Increase on marketing/sales/implementation engineers is typically a solid sign that a company is preparing headcount to take new deals in the upcoming quarters. I look at the product road map, supported integrations, and customer base. 

One example was how I applied the above principle was to WalMart. In 2018 I noticed that I was getting targeted by a lot of Data engineering job listing for WalMartLabs-- WarMart's tech division. The role was to build out a big data pipeline to support their eCommerce platform. WalMart's online store released in Q3 of 2019. Post COVID, I used their online store and it was a seamless experience. They even offer a 5% cash back card like Amazon. They reported strong Q4 sales last year, and they did very well post COVID. Why did I choose to invest in $WMT? Because I believe that Wal-Mart has room to grow for their online platform. 

Lastly... remember that wealth isn't accrued over time. It takes years to build. The quickest way to increase your wealth is by investing in yourself-- your career and earning potential. The sooner my income increased, the quicker I had more capital to buy into stocks. 

Also, if you've gotten this far, the point of my post isn't to say that you should invest into tech. The message I'm trying to get across is-- when picking companies, pick companies in fields or verticals you have good knowledge in. Heed Buffet's advice to only pick companies you believe in and understand. Play to your strengths, don't mindless toss money based on one person's posts on Reddit-- always do your own due diligence. Use DD as a guide and use personal research and experience to drive your decision.",0.84,0.6,0.124371451,0.362185725,28-08-2020 01:58,121.8334351,170.0899963,82.01906586,220.6907806,147.5599976

GOOG,$GOOG: Justice Dept. Plans to File Antitrust Charges Against Google in Coming Weeks,1655,80,1599163106,"[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/03/us/politics/google-antitrust-justice-department.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/03/us/politics/google-antitrust-justice-department.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage)

Key Excerpts:

&#x200B;

>The Justice Department plans to bring an antitrust case against Google as soon as this month, after Attorney General William P. Barr overruled career lawyers who said they needed more time to build a strong case against one of the world’s wealthiest, most formidable technology companies, according to five people briefed on internal department conversations.  
>  
>Justice Department officials told lawyers involved in the antitrust inquiry into Alphabet, the parent company of Google and YouTube, to wrap up their work by the end of September, according to three of the people. Most of the 40-odd lawyers who had been working on the investigation opposed the deadline. Some said they would not sign the complaint, and several of them left the case this summer.

&#x200B;

>Brianna Herlihy, a Justice Department spokeswoman, declined to comment on the continuing investigation. Jose Castaneda, a spokesman for Google, said that the company would “continue to engage with ongoing investigations” and that its business practices enabled “increased choice and competition.”

&#x200B;

>The Justice Department amassed powerful evidence of anticompetitive practices, three people said.  
>  
>But the lawyers also described internal politics that at times slowed down the department’s work or drove a wedge among members of the team.

&#x200B;

>For nearly a year, dozens of Justice Department lawyers and other staff members worked in two groups, each overseeing a separate line of inquiry: Google’s dominance in search and its control over many aspects of the ecosystem for online advertising.

&#x200B;

>Google controls about 90 percent of web searches globally, and rivals have complained that the company extended its dominance by making its search and browsing tools defaults on phones with its Android operating system. Google also captures about one-third of every dollar spent on online advertising, and its ad tools are used to supply and auction ads that appear across the internet.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Antitrust scrutiny of Big Tech seems to have picked up with Google in the Trump Administrations crosshairs. Despite broad bipartisan support in Congress and amongst 50 state AGs, there seems to be some politicking, or at least the appearance of such, that could slow down the government's case.

TSLA,"All those TSLA FOMO's out there, it may be the time to get in",172,230,1599573239,"Every week for the past 8 weeks, I've seen non-stop posts about how people are having great FOMO on TSLA. How they wish they had gotten in at $1000, $1300, $1500, $1750, $2000.

Everyone asking about best price to get in, whether it will go higher, etc.

Well, now TSLA is down almost 40% from its ATH post-split. Pre-split it was at $2200. Then there was a 5:1 split, which drove the price to $440, at which point it rocketed up to $500 (or $2500 pre-split).

Now TSLA has cratered all the way to $340 (or $1700 pre-split). Its back at the price point it was at right after the split was announced. Its still high for some people here, but its trading at a discount from its ATH of $2500.

To all those TSLA FOMO-er's, its time to step up to their conviction. Do you believe in TSLA as the ""company of the future"" that has a valuation potential that can't be captured (ie. ARKK's perspective, and hence their $7000 pre-split price target potential).

Added fun: AMD, BA, MSFT, AAPL are all hammered right now. Again, these are all stocks that I've seen people have incredible FOMO about missing the August run up. If you genuinely believe these stocks have a future, and are thinking long term (ie. over 1 year holdings), these price points are good entries for a DCA strategy. Basically, all these stocks gave up ALL their August gains, which means if you missed the boat at the end of July, nows the time to get back in because the train came back to the station.

If you believe the valuations of these stocks are still too high, then feel free to disregard this entire post.

TSLA,$TSLA - thoughts ahead of Battery Day on Sep 22,60,134,1599676501,"**Oppenheimer:**

""As investors prepare for TSLA’s long anticipated Battery Day, we see four key areas of focus: anode and cathode material design, manufacturing process tech, leverage of the battery management system into powertrain optimization, and its path to solid state batteries, especially its electrolyte development approach. We're also expecting n evolution of TSLA’s main geometry for its cells showing wider diameters and not a move to prismatic cells. Last but not least, we expect an update on its relationships with cell partners like Panasonic and CATL. Given the scale of the opportunity in bothvehicle and stationary power, we expect TSLA to continue working closely with a few battery suppliers to scale production with key steps remaining in TSLA facilities.""

■ ""**Materials:** We believe TSLA has been experimenting and testing materials for well over a decade and that the organization's IP related to material behavior under the harsh conditions of a battery is a defensible advantage. We expect to hear the company discuss silicon and lithium doping, innovation from an electrolyte perspective, and potentially new composite materials that extend cell lifecycle and improve power density.""

■ ""**Process technology**: We believe the 2019 acquisition of Maxwell Technologies was a crucial enabler of TSLA’s roadmap. With increasing complexity of lattice structures for anodes and cathodes, the dry electrode process that Maxwell developed not only eliminates dryers and reduces production cycle times, it facilitates volume production of new composites. We expect meaningful detail on how TSLA will deploy the technology.""

■ ""**System architecture**: We believe TSLA leverages deep understanding of battery cycling and cooling patterns into optimal powertrain performance. We believe the integration of the battery management system with powertrain controls is a key area of differentiation for TSLA. We note TSLA has continued to work on 400V platforms and are watching for potential changes to underlying architecture, particularly related to its truck platforms.""

■ ""**Path to solid state**: With solid state competitors targeting solid state power density above 400W/kg, we'd expect TSLA to give its anticipated time for reaching such levels. We continue to believe one of the key bottlenecks in solid state development is the electrolyte material performance and will be looking for evidence of TSLA’s approach to that issue.""

■ ""**Scale up**: We expect TSLA to continue its approach to scaling capacity by working closely on cell design and process technology with its partners. We believe some of TSLA’s IP is highly sensitive which will lead to select process steps remaining within TSLA facilities even if partners help run the balance of the factory which we believe will help TSLA optimize capital spend.""",0.77,0,0.025757576,0.012878788,09-09-2020 18:35,114.5243607,163.4304962,77.6572876,203.7034454,122.0933304

TSLA,TSLA leaks (supposedly),304,242,1600102905,"At the upcoming Tesla Battery Day conference on September 22, Tesla will officially announce two million-kilometer batteries. If Tesla’s million-kilometer battery is really realized, electric vehicles will achieve a qualitative leap in mileage and battery life, and battery recycling will also become a thing of the past.

Single crystal cathode battery

Tesla single crystal cathode battery, this battery is also a lithium ion battery. It uses a new generation of single crystal NMC532 cathodes and a new brand-new electrolyte, which can enable electric vehicles to travel continuously for 1.6 million kilometers. The battery technology we are using can only maintain about 1,000 charge and discharge cycles, and this battery allows 90% of the battery's capacity to maintain a normal level after 4,000 charge and discharge cycles. Therefore, the single-cathode battery can still maintain 90% capacity after achieving 1.6 million kilometers of travel. This also means that if the battery is installed in a car, even if the whole car is scrapped, the battery can still be used.

Silicon nanowire

anode battery. The weight of the battery cell of this battery will be reduced by half, and the space occupied will be half of the current lithium ion battery. This means that with the same battery volume and quality, the energy density of the battery pack will be greatly improved. At present, the energy density of Tesla batteries is about 250Wh/kg. If this silicon nanowire anode technology is used, the energy density of Tesla batteries will reach about 400Wh/kg. At the same time, this battery has a high cycle life, and mass-produced cells are not far away. If this silicon nanowire anode battery is mass-produced and installed in a car, it may become a changer of current battery technology rules.

Tesla and the battery

As early as 2016, Tesla began funding the Tesla Canada Laboratory, which was composed of a team of scientists led by Jeff Dahn. Dann is a heavyweight in lithium-ion battery research. In more than 40 years, Dann has made many major breakthroughs in battery research. At the same time, in May 2019, Tesla spent US$218 million to acquire Maxwell, which specializes in the development of batteries and capacitors; in October 2019, Tesla acquired Hibar, the world’s number one supercapacitor manufacturer in Canada; in February 2020, SilLion acquired SilLion Inc., a lithium-ion battery company. Today, Tesla has held a number of battery core patents by hiring battery technicians and buying companies.

TSLA,"$TSLA - Morgan Stanley previews Battery Day with ""7 Mind Blowing Things"" they're expecting",81,116,1600355996,"Morgan Stanley:

""Ahead of Tesla's Battery Day on Sep 22nd, we publish some expectation 'benchmarks' for scale, efficiency, cost and technology that we believe may come to light. Based on our work with our Asia Tech team, we expect the event to be potentially narrative changing for Tesla and the battery market.""

""Elon Musk has promised 'mind blowing' battery tech to be unveiled during the highly anticipated September 22nd Battery Day. Our key expectation benchmarks to look out for:

1. **Capacity. We are prepared for Tesla to target Terawatt scale battery capacity plans.** Currently, we forecast Tesla to produce 439 GwH of batteries for their in-house production and 3rd party supply (combined) by 2030, accounting for just over a 26% share of the global EV battery market. Will Tesla target 1TwH by 2035? Or more/sooner?
2. **Battery manufacturing/production efficiency… 16-fold improvement?** With Maxwell, there would be theoretically a 16x production capacity increase by skipping the wet toxic chemicals to create the cathode, which then has to be dried and baked-off and needs a lot of floor space and ovens to meet that process.
3. **A doubling of energy density?** Battery density using the DBE system shows greater than 300 Wh/kg with a path to over 500 Wh/kg. By comparison, Tesla's most advanced (2170) battery today is around 247 Wh/kg. This implies potential to add 20% to its current highest density and could double it in the future. This could lead to vehicles with significantly more range – and could potentially push Tesla Model 3 to about 400 miles per charge with upside from there.
4. **Longevity… 1 million mile battery.** Battery life also shows improved durability with almost 2x improvement as Elon Musk recently stated ‘…the car battery pack is around 3-to-5,000 miles, but the newly designed pack that will go into production for next year is design\[ed\] explicitly for a million miles of operation with minimum maintenance...’. Extension of battery life has implications for cost of ownership, warranty, 2nd/3rd life battery use and buying time to allow the battery recycling infrastructure to catch up.
5. **Goodbye Cobalt?** Tesla has been spending a great deal of effort on researching new chemistries themselves to reduce and remove cobalt from the mix. Tesla’s battery research group led by Jeff Dahn in Halifax applied for a patent in November 2017 that describes a new battery cell chemistry that would result in faster charging and discharging, better longevity, and even lower cost. This has important ESG considerations as well.
6. **Battery $/KwH Targets:** The prevailing view is that battery cell cost can decline at a compound rate of 6 to 7% from just over a $100/KwH level today. Could Tesla communicate plans to potentially double this rate of deflation or to target $50/KwH or less by mid or latter this decade due to the additive/compounding effects of their process efficiencies, scale and energy density improvements? Additionally, we are looking out for an evolution in battery format that could be cylindrical with bigger diameter than the 2170\[0\]’s. Tesla is building a pilot production line to test mass production.
7. **An expectation that Tesla could emerge as a full-stack battery competitor...** Overall, the market appears to be leaning towards Tesla being a faster moving partner with scale that expands the market for all and investors are likely looking to reengage on existing battery makers post the battery day. Investors will likely also be looking closely at the state of collaboration with CATL. The million mile battery or cobalt-free battery is also a pipeline of CATL’s new technology. Tesla and CATL could potentially own the patents of those new technologies together and CATL would potentially be able to help industrialize new battery production.""",0.81,0,0.133817443,0.066908721,17-09-2020 15:19,107.7106857,150.4364929,74.5933075,195.6243439,141.1433258

Now, a few words on the criteria I'm using and sources of data.

&#x200B;

# 1. TheStreet score

The first filtering step is to get stocks with Buy recommendation at TheStreet stock screener ([https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html)](https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/ir-screener.html). I'm only keeping stocks with A or A+ rating (top ones), although A-, B+, B and B- are Buys as well.

From thestreet.com:

***A (Excellent)*** *- The stock has an excellent track record for maximizing performance while minimizing risk, thus delivering the best possible combination of total return on investment and reduced volatility. It has made the most of the recent economic environment to maximize risk-adjusted returns compared to other stocks. While past performance is just an indication -- not a guarantee -- we believe this fund is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future as well.*

And about the methodology (source: [https://www.thestreet.com/r/ratings/reports/detail/T.html](http://Valuation of entry parameters:)):

*TheStreet Ratings' stock model projects a stock's total return potential over a 12-month period including both price appreciation and* ***dividends****. Our Buy, Hold or Sell ratings designate how we expect these stocks to perform against a general benchmark of the equities market and interest rates. While our model is quantitative, it utilizes both* ***subjective*** *and* ***objective*** *elements. For instance, subjective elements include expected equities market returns, future interest rates, implied industry outlook and forecasted company earnings. Objective elements include volatility of past operating revenues, financial strength, and company cash flows.*

# 2. Zacks Rank

It is required that the Zacks Rank is Hold, Buy or Strong Buy (so we're avoiding stocks with Sell and Strong Sell recommendations). The Zacks Rating utilizes a completely different system, based on company earnings-related data, in particular earnings estimate revisions and earnings surprises, to predict profitability of holding the company's shares. More from [https://www.zacks.com/education/stock-education/zacks-rank-guide-6](http://(average, from experts)):

*The Zacks Rank is a proprietary stock-rating model that uses trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises to classify stocks into five groups: Strong Sell, Sell, Hold, Buy, Strong Buy.*

*A portfolio of Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks has beaten the market in 26 of the last 31 years with an average annual return of* ***+24.3%*** *a year; more than double that of the S&P 500's +10.6% .*

# 3. Weiss Ratings recommendation

We're only keeping stocks with Buy (B) or Strong Buy (A) recommendation.

Wjat are these scores? This is what I found at their website ([https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions](https://weissratings.com/help/rating-definitions)):

*""A"" Rating:* ***Excellent.*** *The company’s stock has an excellent track record for providing strong performance with lower-than-average risk, and it is trading at a price that represents good value relative to the company’s earnings prospects. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, our opinion is that this stock is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future. Of course, even the best stocks can decline in a down market. But our “A” rating can generally be considered the equivalent of a ""****Strong Buy****"".*

*""B"" rating:* ***Good.*** *The company’s stock has a good track record for delivering a balance of performance and risk. While the risk-adjusted performance of any stock is subject to change, our opinion is that this stock is a good value, with good prospects for outperforming the market. Although even good investments can decline in a down market, our “B” rating is considered the equivalent of a ""****Buy****"".*

# 4.  Yahoo Finance  recommendation and target price

It is required that the [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold from experts. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current one.

# 5. MarketBeat recommendation and taget price

Similar to Yahoo Finance, it is required that the [MarketBeat](https://www.marketbeat.com/) stock recommendation is at least mixed Buy/Hold. Additionally, the predicted target price (average, from experts) should be at least 5% higher than the current valuation.

# 6. Piotroski F-Score

The Piotroski score is a number between 0-9 that reflects nine criteria used to determine the strength of a company's financial situation, including profitability, leverage or operating efficiency. Zero is the worst value and nine is the best. As we can read in[ Piotroski’s paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9dc9/b030da18ab28d1e1a1bbf7e33fb5911f189e.pdf) from 2000:

*In addition, an investment strategy that buys expected winners and shorts expected losers generates a* ***23% annual return*** *between 1976 and 1996, and the strategy appears to be robust across time and to controls for alternative investment strategies.*

It is required that the score is 4 or higher. The values were retrieved from [https://www.gurufocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/).

# 7. Moody's Daily Credit Risk

Moody’s Daily Credit Risk Score is a 1-10 score, which provides a forward-looking, one-year measure of credit risk. It is updated daily and takes into account day-to-day market movements compared to a company’s liabilities.

The value is retrieved from[ https://markets.businessinsider.com and is expected to be in the range of 1-6. ](https://markets.businessinsider.com/)

# 8. InvestorsObserver Overall Score

The rank has a value in between 0 and 100. It takes into account both **technical** analysis and **fundamental** stock data. An Overall Rank of N means that a given company is rated above N% of stocks, therefore the higher the number, the better. My requirement is that the company has InvestorsObserver Overall score of at least 50.

More detailed explanation from [https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean](https://www.investorsobserver.com/learning-center/what-the-scores-mean/what-does-the-overall-score-mean):

*The Overall Score combines our two technical scores (Short Term and Long Term) with our Fundamental Score into one metric. This makes our overall score a great place to start when evaluating stocks, regardless of your investing style.*

*A low score doesn’t necessarily mean a stock is likely to go down, just that our system doesn’t think there’s much of a bullish case for it.*

Please note that the company profile data (short description) was taken from  [https://www.tradingview.com](https://www.tradingview.com/) (sometimes I shortened it) and dividend data was retrieved from MarketBeat.

AAPL,"$AAPL - Raymond James raise estimates ahead of iPhone 12 launch on ""favorable mix""",183,37,1600780524,"Raymond James:

We reiterate our Outperform rating on Apple and raise our price target to $120. Raising our estimates following our production checks ahead of next quarter’s iPhone 12 launch. While our total production estimates are in-line with current consensus, we expect upside driven by mix. Current production plans suggest the most favorable mix we’ve ever seen for an iPhone launch, and the introduction of a fourth iPhone model at a price between iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro will also help to boost blended ASPs. While the stock has already had a strong run since our upgrade last summer, **we don’t yet think all the benefits of what we expect to be a 2-year 5G upgrade cycle are yet reflected in consensus estimates.**

iPhone 12 mix and pricing. **We conducted channel checks across the iPhone supply chain last week, and confirmed that Apple will launch four new models** in the iPhone 12 lineup this year: an entry-level iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Max, Pro, and Max Pro. We provide a breakdown of specs for each model on the following page. While our sources don't have visibility into pricing at this point, we would expect the base model to start at $699 - the same as last year's iPhone 11, but with a smaller screen. We expect the Pro and Max Pro to remain premium tier phones, priced at $999 and $1099 to start. For the iPhone Max, we expect Apple to likely price it at a modest premium to the base model, in the range of $799.

**Our production checks are consistent with consensus expectations, but mix appears favorable.** According to our checks, build plans support production of \~75 million units for the launch, including 64 million new models. While we believe this is consistent with industry expectations, the mix assumptions driven by the initial build plans **suggest a meaningful rise in blended ASPs**. There's no guarantee that current build plans will reflect what consumers will actually buy, but the build plans provide insight into Apple's expectations. The table on the following page illustrates our production and sell-through estimates for the December quarter. We're assuming that Apple will build more aggressively on higher priced SKUs to make sure they are available for holiday purchases, and we expect that lower priced SKUs will likely sell out before Christmas.

Adjusting estimates. While our September quarter estimates remain unchanged (and well below consensus), we are **raising our FY21 EPS estimate to $3.93 to reflect our current assumptions for iPhone 12 mix**. Notably, if we assume December quarter sell-through matches production estimates, our revenue and EPS estimates would move higher by \~$5.3 billion and $0.09, respectively. For FY22, our split-adjusted estimate moves to $4.53, assuming Apple keeps the fourtier pricing scheme for the upcoming iPhone 13 and 14 cycles.

Our new $120 price target (from $110) is based on a \~26x multiple on our split-adjusted FY22 EPS estimate and 19x an annualized estimate of peak seasonal EPS of over $6/share. While this is above the 3- and 5-year average in the \~15x range, on an EV/FCF basis, our price target assumes an 18x multiple, well below the historical range in the low-20s.",0.93,0,0.081219168,0.040609584,22-09-2020 13:15,109.145668,156.4494934,73.0934906,199.9723969,141.4100037

Well, it is difficult to explain why to every person individually and this new video from Ben Felix explains the reason why expertly.

The conclusion the video comes to is that you should just stick to low cost index funds (preferably globally diversified) rather than investing into large cap growth or trying to find the next Apple or Amazon.

Now, it sounds absolutely crazy when I say this, but the first thoughts that popped into my head when I was watching this live - as a non-engineer - if what Elon and his co-presenter are saying, they have a *massive* moat around them. That is, the engineering capabilities they demonstrated on stage were explained somewhat not terribly, but still made sense to me. With that said, what did you guys think?

Also, some questions for the electrical engineers/others who have experience in this field - how viable and how possible does this innovation seem to you? Is this revolutionary as Elon is saying?

For everyone else, does this make anyone else feel like they are undervaluing TSLA? I mean, it definitely put some doubt in me as to my current valuation. This morning, if you had asked me, I would’ve definitely said yes. After watching this, I am not so sure. I might even increase the value of the company.  Now, I am an Elon fan but I also know his tendency to not follow through with deadlines, yet still succeeding massively due to his ability to build things from ground up (his first-principles .

 Is the comprehensive innovation he is bringing to the whole of the batteries - all the components make TSLA worth more than it is currently? If not, how come?

TSLA,$TSLA - summary of analyst thoughts following Battery Day,745,284,1600870678,"**BULLS:**

**Oppenheimer: ""Doing More With Less.** TSLA outlined a robust reimagining of battery design, manufacturing, and performance including targeting a $25K vehicle in three years and 20x capacity increase by 2030. It is ramping a pilot line featuring a comprehensive redesign of product architecture, basic materials, and process technology and expects to yield \~56% cost declines, 54% range improvement, and 69% capex reduction, with initial benefits seen over 12–18 months, achieviing run-rate at \~three years. TSLA reiterated 30–40% delivery growth in 2020 (implied 478–515K) ahead of consensus estimates. We are impressed with the ambition of the endeavor and believe this roadmap charts ongoing technology and cost leadership for TSLA enabling sales into the entire LDV market. While limited details may weigh on shares, we would be buyers on any near-tearm weakness.""

**ON THE FENCE:**

**Morgan Stanley: ""A Call to Arms.** Tesla’s battery day largely lived up to the hype, but didn’t clearly exceed it. We think the main narrative is that Tesla’s battery tech is outpacing current growth in supply… and it's time to spend significantly.""

**Credit Suisse: ""Battery Day plan shows elevated growth narrative ahead, but consider challenges in manufacturing ramp.** Tesla’s much anticipated Battery Day brought several key positives: 1. Battery plans to support aggressive growth over next decade; 2. Growth unlocked via cost reductions on multiple fronts, highlighted by ambitious vertical integration plans; 3. Yet another reminder Tesla is well ahead of other automakers in the push to EV. However, the biggest driver of Tesla’s success in its strategy will be its ability to successfully ramp manufacturing, and we expect challenges along the way. Amid lofty expectations into the event, we see a ‘sell the news’ reaction on the stock given Tesla is still 3 years away from its planned $25,000 vehicle and full benefits from its battery strategy. That said, we ultimately expect weakness to be bought as the event highlighted Tesla’s robust growth narrative.""

**Canaccord Genuity: ""Battery Day hits on manufacturing strategies, but may disappoint for those that see a tech juggernaut.** As expected, Tesla’s Battery Day and shareholder meeting provided a trove of clues as to the direction of the company. For Bulls, the operational and systems approach to reduce manufacturing costs for autos and energy might be enough to warrant momentum. Bears, however, are likely to point the shift towards what looks increasingly like a modern day auto OEM than a tech company.""

**Goldman: ""Capacity, Battery Tech and Cost in focus.** Tesla believes that it will see the initial impact of these changes within 12-18 months, and the full impact in about 3 years. In addition, Tesla stated that it could release a $25,000 car in about 3 years as a result of the reduction in pack cost. We believe that a vehicle at this price point (coupled with Tesla's other products) would help Tesla to address a wide range of the light vehicle market (and furthermore EVs offer savings for the typical US driver in the form of lower maintenance and fuel costs that we have previously estimated are about $800 per year vs. an ICE vehicle). We expect the ability and timing for Tesla to fully achieve these targets to be one investor debate post the event, as Tesla has not always met its past targets. While we are incrementally positive on long-term EV adoption, we believe that the company's premium multiple (Exhibit 4 and Exhibit 5) currently reflects this.""

**BEARS:**

\*\*Barclays: ""\*\*while it had the usual set of aggressive forward-looking targets, the key question of the stock is whether a more subdued Musk – who uncharacteristically cautioned that the battery innovations were ‘close to working’ – is enough to sustain the valuation. We can see a few days of ‘sell the news,’ especially as Musk did not forecast either the 1 million mile battery (which many Tesla fans expected) or using Tesla cars for vehicle to gird (which we expected), and the ‘one more thing’ was delayed Model S Plaid performance variant. Moreover, the Plaid variant was delayed. After that, however, attention will shift to delivery forecasts for 3Q20, where Musk was silent other than forecasting 30-40% unit growth for 2020.""

**Needham: ""Will Vertical Integration Make or Break Tesla? We Have 3 Years to Find Out.** At its well-hyped Battery Day yesterday, TSLA announced its transformational plans to more than halve the cost per $/KWH of its batteries through the strategy of vertical integration. The ultimate goal is to increase range by 54%, while cutting cost/KWh by 56% and investment per GWh by 69% in five steps: cell design, cell factory, anode materials, cathode materials and cell vehicle integration (outlined below). This plan will take three years to be fully implemented. While we applaud the company's ambitious plans, we believe it is an inherently risky move with steep execution and operational challenges.""",0.93,0,0.092348084,0.046174042,23-09-2020 14:17,104.567421,149.9929962,70.58715057,193.3876495,126.7866669
AMZN,$AMZN - media business now estimated to be worth nearly $600bn with launch of Luna,864,182,1601044288,"Needham:

""Yesterday, at AMZN's devices and services event, AMZN announced Luna+, a $6/month (intro price) cloud gaming subscription competitor to Google's Stadia ($10/month), Microsoft xCloud($15/month), and EA's Origin Access ($15/month). **Although AMZN's content is inferior to competitors today, we expect its Customer Acquisition Costs (CAC) to be below competitors, thanks to its Twitch and AWS integrations.**""

""We believe additional value from Luna+ comes from: a) building brand trust with the next generation (16-26 year olds); b) upside from sub revs, which are valued at 9x Rev vs AMZN's avg of 4x; and, c) a new rev stream using AWS & Twitch that raises AMZN’s barriers to entry.""

""**We calculate that AMZN's media revenue streams are worth nearly $600B, or about 40% of AMZN's total EV, suggesting these businesses are the most undervalued piece of AMZN.**""

""Advertising's Hidden Value. The ""hidden"" value of AMZN's advertising's expected 50% y/y growth in FY21E is important because many public companies with comparable ad rev growth rates trade above 7x and up to 22x revs. We use an average of 14.5x EV/Rev.""

""Subscription Revs Hidden Value. Similarly, subscription revenue streams typically trade at much higher EV/Rev multiples than AMZN's core business, so anything that adds revenue in subscription silos grows AMZN's value faster, we believe. Consumer-facing subscription revenue is generally predictable, sticky, has upside optionality to add more rev/month over time, and has high switching costs and barriers to entry. As a consequence, many subscription business models trade at 7x-12x EV/Rev, well above AMZN's avg.""

""Luna. By implication, successful growth of subscriber revenue streams suggests faster upside valuation revisions for AMZN. A gating factor to this potential upside value driver is introducing new subscription services, like Luna.""

""Twitch and AWS Integrations Lower AMZN's Risks. AMZN's economic risks of Luna failing is lower than its competitors because it already owns the cloud servers required through AWS, and it also owns the dominant video game viewing platform in Twitch, which it is integrating into Luna. Both AWS and Twitch should lower Luna's CAC. Therefore, even if Luna fails, it should cost far less than other companies that don't already own cloud servers and a huge number of video gamers already spending hours per day on a sister-platform.""",0.95,0.2,0.097839827,0.148919913,25-09-2020 14:31,109.6044617,154.7565002,72.07100677,200.358017,135.7799988

""Tesla's Battery Day on 22 September was one of the industry's most anticipated events. Technical claims and cost ambitions (JEFe $50-60/Kwh) exceeded our expectations but raised key questions, from material availability to manufacturing processes. We turn to Professor Gerbrand Ceder from UC Berkeley for a critical analysis of the presentation, discussing among other topics: nickel availability, alternative chemistries and manufacturing challenges.""

Highlights from Q&A

""**Innovation** \- Many of the announced technical developments were anticipated and consistent with battery industry innovations but Tesla's strength remains in the drive to ""push boundaries"" and the time-scale for execution.""

""**Materials** \- Constraints on nickel supply may accelerate. Tesla battery capacity of 3 Twh by 2030 would require most of today's nickel production. Timeframe too short for material substitution. Lithium availability not an issue but extraction/refining over-simplified. Constrains can lead to vertical integration including capturing supplier margin. Solid state will eventually make silicon irrelevant.""

""**Chemistries** \- Doubts about the validity of LFP chemistry for automotive but more relevant for storage, where sodium-ion also looks relevant.""

""**Manufacturing** \- Cost roadmap looked ambitious considering manufacturing accounts for only 15-20% of total battery cost.

The stock bounced around in extended trading after Amazon provided a wide guidance range for the fourth quarter.

* **Earnings:** $12.37 vs $7.41 per share expected, according to analysts surveyed by Refinitiv
* **Revenue:** $96.15 billion vs $92.7 billion expected, according to analysts surveyed by Refinitiv

Amazon  said sales in the fourth quarter will be between $112 billion and $121  billion, which comes out to growth of 28% to 38% from a year earlier.  Analysts were expecting revenue of $112.3 billion. 

The company  forecast operating income of $1 billion to $4.5 billion, assuming about  $4.0 billion of costs tied to COVID-19. That's a step up from the second quarter,  when Amazon said it would spend more than $2 billion on  coronavirus-related measures, including procuring personal protective  equipment, enhanced cleaning of its facilities and wage increases. 

Amazon  continues to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the pandemic, as  consumers flocked to the site for essential goods, groceries and  household items. Amazon is expected to face even greater demand heading  into the holiday season, with shoppers likely to do the bulk of their  gift buying online instead of making trips to the store.

""We're  seeing more customers than ever shopping early for their holiday gifts,  which is just one of the signs that this is going to be an unprecedented  holiday season,"" Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said in a statement.

Bezos  also touted Amazon's recent job creation and treatment of warehouse  workers, which has been a subject of scrutiny in recent months. The  Amazon CEO pointed to Amazon's $15 minimum wage and challenged other  large employers to ""make the jump to $15.""

Amazon is one of few companies that has continued to grow its headcount  amid a broader economic downturn due to the coronavirus crisis. The  company now counts more than 1.12 million full-time employees across the  globe, an increase of 50% year over year. That figure doesn't include  Amazon's network of contractors and temporary workers. 

Amazon's cloud-computing unit, Amazon Web Services, generated  sales of $11.6 billion for the quarter, up 29% year over year and in  line with analysts' estimates, according to FactSet. Operating income in  the segment of $3.54 billion topped estimates of $3.45 billion. The  segment was helped by millions of people working from home.  

The  company's ""other"" category, which is primarily comprised of its  advertising business, saw revenue of $5.4 billion, up 51% year over  year. Subscription services, which includes revenue from Prime  memberships, climbed 33% year over year to $6.58 billion.

Once  again, third-party sales grew more than Amazon's first-party business.  Third-party sales increased 55% year-over-year, while first-party sales  grew 38% year-over-year. Sales fell 10% in Amazon's physical store unit,  which includes Whole Foods Market.

Amazon shares are up 74% this year, the best performance among the five most valuable U.S. tech companies. 

Three of those companies — Apple, Alphabet and Facebook — also reported quarterly results after the bell on Thursday and all exceeded analysts' estimates.

Amazon will hold a call with investors to discuss its third-quarter results starting at 5:30 p.m. ET.

_____
The lack of fiscal first-quarter 2021 guidance from Apple means that investors and analysts don’t get a hint at how Apple is projecting the sales performance of the iPhone 12, which went on sale in October. 


Apple stock dropped over 4% in extended trading.

“If you look at the case count, the case counts are climbing in Western Europe. They’re climbing in the United States. And so there’s still a sufficient level of uncertainty out there… we don’t believe that’s an environment to guide into,” Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC’s Josh Lipton. 

Apple hasn’t offered guidance for the past two quarters because of uncertainty related to the Covid-19 pandemic. 

However, Cook said that he was optimistic about iPhone 12 sales for a number of reasons, including 5G support, carrier promotions, and a loyal install base, and said that “initial data points are really quite good.”

iPhone revenue was down over 16% from the same quarter last year and came up short against Wall street expectations. However, many investors and analysts are more focused on how the iPhone 12 will sell in the coming year. Apple’s iPhones went on sale this year in October, and more models are planned for next month, meaning that sales from the new devices aren’t counted in this quarter.

Revenue for Macs and iPads both exceeded analyst expectations, most likely driven by strong work-from-home trends during the pandemic. Apple drew attention to strong results in those categories last quarter, too. Overall, Mac revenue was up 29% year-over-year and iPad revenue rose 46% from the same quarter last year. 

Sales in China were a weak point for Apple. Sales in greater China, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, dropped to $7.95 billion from $11.13 billion a year before, over a 28% decrease.

“A larger percentage of China revenue is made up of new iPhones. And so that’s the reason the number for the total quarter started with a minus sign. But given what we see in the early going with the new iPhones, we’re confident we’ll grow in Q1,” Cook told CNBC.

Apple released new Apple Watch Series 6 models that went on sale in September. The category that those devices are counted in for sales is called Wearables, Home, and Accessories, which came in slightly higher than expectations. The category also includes sales from headphones such as AirPods and Beats. Sales for the category were up over 20% on a year-over-year basis. 

Investors are always closely examining Apple’s services business, which includes subscriptions like iCloud and Apple Music, fees from the App Store paid by app developers, and licensing revenue. Services revenue exceeded Wall Street expectations and grew 16% over last year. 

On Friday, Apple will release bundles of its subscription services called Apple One, Reuters reported. The bundles vary by region but include Apple Music, iCloud storage, and Apple TV+ streaming video.",0.96,0,0.103645147,0.051822574,29-10-2020 21:01,112.5720291,160.5505066,78.17002869,197.3693085,136.9433289

**So what are the Fundamental characteristics of a TML? You want to see superior:**

* Quarterly Sales Growth > 25% YoY
* Quarterly Earnings Growth > 25% YoY
* Pre+After Tax Margins >20% Recent Quarters
* ROE >17%
* Annual Earnings Ests for the next year > 25%

And above all else you want the stock to have a great story- A new and innovative product or service  that changes how we work live or play. Not every TML will have all of these criteria, but in general their record should be outstanding with regards to most of them. The higher these values the better. Earnings and Sales growth over 100% YoY is ideal. Annual Estimates for next year over 100% would be exceptional.

TMLs are also often in the Top 20 Industry groups at the times of their runs. The TML is the leader of an overall top group which is riding the tailwinds of changing environments. Recent examples $SE $SHOP $AMZN Retail-Internet and $TSLA $NIO Electric Vehicles (Auto Manufacturers)

Additionally base liquidity is required for these stocks to be institutional quality. Dollar Volume > $30 Million is essential and most should have DV much higher than that. Accumulation by big hedge funds and mutual funds like Fidelity Contrafund are what move the markets. They won't touch a promising stock unless it has liquidity.

**Now for Technical (Price Action) Characteristics of TMLs.**

They should be:

* Above a Rising 30 Week Moving Average
* Breaking out of a Stage 1 or Stage 2 Base
* Trending above Key Moving Averages (10, 21ema, 50sma)
* Volume and Price contractions within bases
* Up/Down Vol> 1.2
* Huge gaps up on volume after Earning Beat
* And most importantly they must be showing Relative Strength, meaning they are outperforming the vast majority of stocks in the market. This. is. vital.

During corrections and overall market weakness they should be near all time highs, above their longer term moving averages.  They should be standing out like a sore thumb and yelling ""Buy me"".  And during Market Uptrends they should be trending above the shorter term moving averages, forming sideways price shelfs during small pullbacks and then breaking out again. Most stay above their 50 SMAs and even 21 emas for extended periods of time.

**So how to scan for them:**

Use MarketSmith, the IBD Stock Screener, Finviz, or another screener and screen for the fundamental criteria mentioned above combined with the stock over the 200+50 SMA.  It's helpful to have multiple screens splitting up the criteria for instance one scan for the earnings and one for sales.

   	He generally invests in fundamentals, and you don’t invest into Tesla based on fundamentals. 
   	However, he is toward the end of his career and slowly letting go of the reins at Berkshire Hathaway, and maybe other leaders at the firm like Tesla?

TSLA,TSLA: Get ready to cash out from the largest ongoing pump and dump in history,2137,772,1606738256,"Ok, so TSLA will be included in S&P 500 in Dec 21. Old news.

The only reason I have been holding TSLA after it split is the whole S&P 500 inclusion thingy. After that, I don't know what will even move this stock. They freakin surpassed Berkshire and could surpass Facebook(for a short time)!!!

Today they will announce whether to include TSLA in two sessions or in one session.

[This is what happened when Yahoo was included(which is comparable to TSLA's inclusion as they have had relatively comparable size in comparison to S&P 500's size). Although I believe TSLA will rise again after some time, unlike Yahoo.](https://imgur.com/a/1qj22eR)

After the trading sessions, expect a big dip. As a lot of speculators this year have bought into TSLA precisely to front-run the index investors.

Also, the trade date Dec. 18, coincides with a once-quarterly event known as quadruple witching, the Friday near the end of each calendar quarter on which options and futures on both indexes and stocks expire simultaneously. Volume is usually heavy on those days and would help boost liquidity on the day of Tesla’s inclusion, investors said. (this paragraph copied straight from wsj)

So, I guess don't be a fool(unless there are some tax implications, which I don't have); buy the rumour, sell the news. TSLA will completely tank after the inclusion.

Also, remember NIO etc kind of benefit from the TSLA hype, so be very careful you all about them.

I don't think if you don't have any immediate tax implications, there wouldn't be much value holding TSLA for the longer term as there are better long term plays. And when or if TSLA reaches $700 or higher(I know I am very bullish, but that's why I am still holding it) there would be almost no point in holding it any longer.

Some special points to remember:

* TSLA already jumped 40% after its inclusion news broke out and had been steadily climbing before it due to rumour that it will be included in the index and Softbank's trade earlier this year.
* TSLA can issue more shares, especially in this valuation. I mean why wouldn't they, lol.

I know posts that say anything negative about TSLA gets downvoted but be careful about your TSLA shares or options!

Ark Invest's Cathie Wood isn't betting on Uber Technologies Inc UBER, -1.55% and LYFT Inc LYFT, -2.42% over Tesla Inc TSLA, +2.44%.

What Happened: Wood, CEO of New York-based Ark Invest, said in a tweet Saturday night that Uber and Lyft missed out on a data opportunity that ties in to AI — and which companies will most benefit from it.

Wood said the ride-sharing companies ""stayed private too long and lost the plot. They could have incentivized their drivers to put sensors on their cars and collect data much faster than even $TSLA.""

The tweet was in response to a question about Ark Invest's portfolio.

Data collection and AI are closely intertwined because machine learning systems develop faster and with greater precision when they are paired with large data sets.

Why It Matters: Wood's opinion carries weight. She has become the breakout star of the 2020 bull market as her actively-managed ETFs generate phenomenal returns. Shares of her ARK Innovation ETF ARKK, -1.43% are up over 163% this year.

TSLA,Why the $TSLA bubble will not burst?,21,281,1609452730,"A correction (\~-20%) can happen, but the bubble will not burst (where $TSLA loses more than 50%-90% of its value). Here's why:  

So a lot of people often use the dotcom bubble as a parallel to speculate the pop of the Tesla bubble. The most immediate comparisons come from names such as Amazon, which lost nearly 90% of its value from the peak of the bubble but was eventually able to gain back most of its shares. Other comparisons also include stocks such as Yahoo, which was actually added to the S&P 500 in 1999, right before the bubble burst, or even Qualcomm/Cisco. 

These speculations and comparisons are always interesting to think about. They come from deductions, aka where you extrapolate data points from the past in order to predict what is going to happen in the future. However, a deduction is often not the most useful mental model, especially when circumstances are different in the future. And this is one of those cases where the circumstances are actually very different. 

Now the basic argument of ""Tesla is not a car company"" is often overused. Yes, Tesla creates batteries, they are going into the autonomous market soon, their AutoPilot is one of the best AI that the world has today (stronger than NVIDIA's GPUs), they are going to get into the insurance game, they are going to get into the financing industry, some people might even say they are going to collaborate with Space X to create flying cars in 2050. That's all great. However, I'm actually going to argue that despite all of these things, Tesla's current price is overvalued but yet, the stock will not burst. And this has in large part to do with how the markets and trader psychology works today, and how different it is from 1999/2000:

As information and financial data has become more widely available through the internet, the markets have had a tendency to price things way ahead of it's time. For example, Tesla believers (bloggers/Youtubers/communities) can now share their bull case for Tesla and what the company will do years and years down the line. While CEOs and company personnel are not allowed to share such projections due to SEC rules, there is nothing stopping these communities from doing so. The most prominent of this has perhaps been Cathie Wood's ARK Invest. She laid out the case for Tesla way back in 2017, and as some of her projections (such as Tesla's profitability) have proven to be correct, people have now become believers that her entire bull case (of Tesla owning the entire autonomous space) will eventually be correct. In a way, the market has become this binary mechanism. FOMO kicks in due to the widespread information that is available, and people pile in. Now, most Tesla bulls believe in the $7000 PT (pre-split) that Cathie Wood has put on this stock, and I doubt very many people are going to be willing to sell before that price. In 1999, if a hedge fund manager was very bullish on a stock, most other investors had no way of knowing. There has been trend towards open-sourcing investing ideas from many investors, and this is a massive deal with Tesla. Other examples of this include Rob Baron or Chamath, who are also very famous investors and well-known Tesla bulls. 20 years ago, investing ideas were supposed to be secretive, with retail investors very much out of the know and speculating on their own. This is no longer the case today. 

In a way, we now live in an investing world of stories, where the story of a stock matters more than the numbers, and these stories get reverberated through social media communities. What a company will do 20 years down the line is a story that is just now more widely available. So even if Tesla stock drops by 10-15% tomorrow, I believe that there are enough believers in this story where they will just continue to buy up the stock from those prices. ""Buy the dip"" has become this sort of motto in many of these investing communities, and this same theory is true for any of these companies that seem to be outlandishly valued as Tesla. 

The bottom line is: As long as the story stays, the bubble of Tesla will not pop. Even if Tesla has a bad quarter but their long term outlook stays the same, I very much think this will stand true. The only way this bubble pops is if the story changes somehow. That can either be from investors such as ARK saying they no longer believe in the long term hypothesis or other events such as the death of Elon Musk. Otherwise, Tesla will very much continue to stand strong.",0.6,0,0.163517099,0.081758549,31-12-2020 22:12,129.7515564,162.8464966,87.37941742,214.9951935,235.2233276
TSLA,Pricing everything as if they are the next AMZN (TSLA story),1232,532,1609598691,"One of the things that amazes me currently in this market is that, it feels like we are trying to justify every new coming hot tech/growth company as if they are the next AMZN in their field. I think one of the delusions people are having lately is that they look at what people projected for AMZN 5-10-15 years ago and compare that to what actually happened.

While it is true that AMZN exceeded any sort of expectation by a huge margin (and did this consistently, year over year) it feels to me that we are taking perhaps one of the most unique success stories ever and then extrapolate that to others, thinking that as if those sort of growth and expectations are in fact more common and easy to achieve than not, regardless of the industry the subject company is operating in.

I could discuss this for a number of stocks, I wanted to open discussion for TSLA. As we all know, TSLA stock went up almost 8 fold in the last year. Today, it is common occurrence in the market that analysts are justifying these price levels and state why TSLA is just more than a car company. This argument obviously has its own merits, but aren't we little ahead ourselves and already attribute *from today,* all those things that could potentially be achieved and bake it into the price?

If we went back in in time, we could probably say AMZN was more than just a book company, but could we really say that they would have almost monopolistic power in most of the areas they operated in? Could we really say back in 2008 that AMZN would emerge the market leader in something like for instance Cloud? Or, did these things happen and then we realized how great AMZN became, *after the fact.* It feels like this was much easier to do in hindsight. But what if AMZN is truly that one outlier, anomaly, in the history of stock markets in terms of sustained growth and market power?

Isn't this what we are trying to do with TSLA here? I do think Elon is one of the greatest minds of our time and can achieve far beyond any other has achieved so I am not comparing Bezos or any other with Elon here. But what I am trying to say is that, just thinking TSLA as a company, aren't we already saying today that they already have monopolistic power in EV cars, autonomous driving, solar-energy trade, underground tunnels, robotaxis, etc. - you name it, as if they are already there and waiting to be switched on? It's as if we have already attributed everything we could imagine could happen and already announced TSLA as the winner.

Now this is the theory side of things. **How about financial side of things?**

I don't want to approach this from a car sales point of view, but I will make certain comments.

But what if we applied AMZN's growth trajectory into TSLA, without focusing too much on car sales, and just see what growth and valuation that would lead us? If TSLA is just more than a car company, what other example could serve best in terms of growth, thinking from an array of products and technological advantage perspective?

So I did a quick and dirty DCF calculation. In there, my starting point is the first year when AMZN hit $24 billion in revenue, which is 2009. TSLA achieved it's $24 billion in 2019, so from there onwards I am applying AMZN's growth trajectory for the following 10-11 years. Then, growth is gradually reduced in going into the terminal year. What this means is TSLA will be roughly $900 billion revenue generating company by year 20 (2040). From a car sales perspective, I can't really project how many cars it could sell in 20 years, but lets say it is 10 million cars. (I think GS said 15 million). Toyota in 2019 sold around this number I believe so with all the competition that will happen in this space, I think this is by no means and under-estimation. In 2019, TSLA sold roughly 367,500 cars and for a total revenue of $19.2 billion (excluding regulatory credits). On average this equates to $52k per car. In 20 years, car prices will be higher than what they are today obviously, but there will be competition and economies of scale to bring the price down. This one is hard to assume but let's say it grows 1.0% - 1.5% per year with long term inflation, again not necessarily higher because of these offsetting factors. If they do indeed sell 10+ million cars, this is roughly $600-650 billion from cars.

This leaves you with another $200-250 billion or so for other things, whatever you want to attribute this for - AI, robotaxies, insurance, and so on. Now this figure is a future value, so from today's perspective (using a discount rate of 8% used in my DCF below) that's roughly $60 billion (revenue). This is again a huge number, as it is almost another Facebook, 2x Coca-Cola etc., or half of GM/Toyota type business from revenue generating capability, again, from *today's perspective - none of which has already happened.*

Once again I want to point out that my revenue projections are not driven by bottoms-up car sales, rather, I am using simply AMZN trajectory in terms of growth, then try to attribute the resulting final revenue figure into parts, obviously majority being from car sales, and the rest from whatever you can think of. (Simply because we don't know what AI/Robos/Insurance/Transportation businesses can generate from revenue/profitability/market share perspective and more importantly what the competition in those areas can be). If you think TSLA can grow even more than AMZN, then I just want to remind you that you won't easily justify 40-50% revenue growth rates once you're in the 50+ billion zone, which is the point of the argument. AMZN, still achieved those growth rates when it had 100+ or 200+ billion, which is what we are already assuming here.

So in the stock price we have baked in, from a revenue perspective, a car business that will sell at least 10+ million cars (this number can obviously be higher but even 10 million will be big market share),  and other businesses that are worth, today, more than most companies you can think of.

Now this is the growth side of things. How about margins?

We know TSLA generated a last twelve months EBITDA margin of 14% as of Q3 2020. While margins from car manufacturing is certainly improving, most of this margin is actually attributed to sales of regulatory credits, which are by definition almost 100% profit. And so in reality, the margins are much lower, maybe around low single digits between 1-5%. Now this is important because even with all this revenue growth (and if you disagree with me and think it will even be higher), you still need to achieve big margins on your business. I mean really really good margins, we are talking about 15-25% each year. Interestingly, AMZN, while growing its top line crazily over the years and becoming a behemoth as it is today, always lacked in terms of their margins. That goes without saying they are a tech company that typically exhibit great returns on capital. So the point is they had to sacrifice their margins to be able to achieve this growth and this is an important point.

In my DCF, I am extremely generous. I kept TSLA's EBITDA margins at 15% for the next 3 years, bumped to 17.5%, 20.0%, then to finally 25.0% every 3 years in going forward. Once again these regulatory credits will not be there forever so those margins are extremely optimistic at this point. They might indeed achieve 25% margins in 10 years or so but it won't be this smooth.

With these two major factors, other items in the DCF are not super important. The discount rate is 8.0%, which I believe is reasonable, NWC and Capex assumptions are in line with what they are today and I don't think they would necessarily go down (if not go up). I just want to mention that you may completely disagree with some of the assumptions I outlined above. The point however is no matter what sort of DCF you come up with, you will end up either with lower or slight higher value for TSLA, using very, very aggressive assumptions for 10+ years. So the point and question is around the **margin of safety** here.

It seems I can't directly post pictures so here is the link for the DCF:

[https://ibb.co/mSHDcBh](https://ibb.co/mSHDcBh)

You might wonder, well your price is even higher than what it is today so why did you write this.

Once again my whole point in the argument was that the margin of error in TSLA's stock price right now is non-existent, because we've already treated it the next AMZN, gave the best margins possible, attributed big bucks on its other stuff. I think my DCF is still in the unreasonable side, but I wanted to point this out that even a s*light change in trajectory would mean a totally different path and stock price for TSLA.*

So the question is, are we ahead of ourselves with TSLA? This could also apply to others as well, this so called growth companies. It is as if we are pricing everything today and think that they have already achieved incredible market share in everything they touched and it's only a matter of time that these revenue/profits are realized. Are we taking one anomaly and applying this rationale for every other great company under the name of ""it's tech""? Elon is great and TSLA will be great. But the business model may not just allow them to be the next AMZN, regardless of technology or improvement.

One final comment I will make is related to autonomous driving and data TSLA is collecting. While it is for certain that this data gives TSLA an incredible power in developing this technology, I see couple of issues with this as it relates to future of this thing.

Companies such as Facebook are big not because of their software, but because of the network effects they exhibit. And because of those network effects they become larger and larger and are able to collect more data, which creates an incredibly profitable cycle for them as they can monetize that data right away. Data for TSLA here only matters in developing that technology. Monetization however, is another story.

What I am not entirely sure with all this AI story is that if it needs to continuously get updated for use, then how do regulators/companies determine the older version was safe to use to begin with. What I understand is that AI is something that needs to get constantly updated based on data, challenge here is that you are carrying people's lives here (as opposed to targeting ads) so there needs to be an infliction point where the full autonomous driving AI software should be at a point where it is certainly 100% safe to use. Because if it is not, then the technology fails until it reaches to that point. If it does reach out to that point, then how difficult is it going to be for others to get to that point or use similar technology if what you need is to get from point A to B safely.

Besides there is the price factor in as well. Let's say TSLA is the only one who can do this. If autonomous driving is too expensive, then how much will people pay for it? Say if the car is 50k and you have to pay extra 50k on top of that - would you do this? Would this have a cannibalization effect? Or if it is monthly subscription fees, would you go on to pay this forever? How significant will the cost be in 20 years from now when others presumably also start providing some sort of service.

On the other hand, if it is not expensive and only a fraction of the car price, then how are you going to achieve these growth levels with that data and technology to begin with. It is one thing to have a great technology, another to monetize it. They might license it for sure, but then you lose all that power right away.

AMZN,Pricing everything as if they are the next AMZN (TSLA story),1231,532,1609598691,"One of the things that amazes me currently in this market is that, it feels like we are trying to justify every new coming hot tech/growth company as if they are the next AMZN in their field. I think one of the delusions people are having lately is that they look at what people projected for AMZN 5-10-15 years ago and compare that to what actually happened.

While it is true that AMZN exceeded any sort of expectation by a huge margin (and did this consistently, year over year) it feels to me that we are taking perhaps one of the most unique success stories ever and then extrapolate that to others, thinking that as if those sort of growth and expectations are in fact more common and easy to achieve than not, regardless of the industry the subject company is operating in.

I could discuss this for a number of stocks, I wanted to open discussion for TSLA. As we all know, TSLA stock went up almost 8 fold in the last year. Today, it is common occurrence in the market that analysts are justifying these price levels and state why TSLA is just more than a car company. This argument obviously has its own merits, but aren't we little ahead ourselves and already attribute *from today,* all those things that could potentially be achieved and bake it into the price?

If we went back in in time, we could probably say AMZN was more than just a book company, but could we really say that they would have almost monopolistic power in most of the areas they operated in? Could we really say back in 2008 that AMZN would emerge the market leader in something like for instance Cloud? Or, did these things happen and then we realized how great AMZN became, *after the fact.* It feels like this was much easier to do in hindsight. But what if AMZN is truly that one outlier, anomaly, in the history of stock markets in terms of sustained growth and market power?

Isn't this what we are trying to do with TSLA here? I do think Elon is one of the greatest minds of our time and can achieve far beyond any other has achieved so I am not comparing Bezos or any other with Elon here. But what I am trying to say is that, just thinking TSLA as a company, aren't we already saying today that they already have monopolistic power in EV cars, autonomous driving, solar-energy trade, underground tunnels, robotaxis, etc. - you name it, as if they are already there and waiting to be switched on? It's as if we have already attributed everything we could imagine could happen and already announced TSLA as the winner.

Now this is the theory side of things. **How about financial side of things?**

I don't want to approach this from a car sales point of view, but I will make certain comments.

But what if we applied AMZN's growth trajectory into TSLA, without focusing too much on car sales, and just see what growth and valuation that would lead us? If TSLA is just more than a car company, what other example could serve best in terms of growth, thinking from an array of products and technological advantage perspective?

So I did a quick and dirty DCF calculation. In there, my starting point is the first year when AMZN hit $24 billion in revenue, which is 2009. TSLA achieved it's $24 billion in 2019, so from there onwards I am applying AMZN's growth trajectory for the following 10-11 years. Then, growth is gradually reduced in going into the terminal year. What this means is TSLA will be roughly $900 billion revenue generating company by year 20 (2040). From a car sales perspective, I can't really project how many cars it could sell in 20 years, but lets say it is 10 million cars. (I think GS said 15 million). Toyota in 2019 sold around this number I believe so with all the competition that will happen in this space, I think this is by no means and under-estimation. In 2019, TSLA sold roughly 367,500 cars and for a total revenue of $19.2 billion (excluding regulatory credits). On average this equates to $52k per car. In 20 years, car prices will be higher than what they are today obviously, but there will be competition and economies of scale to bring the price down. This one is hard to assume but let's say it grows 1.0% - 1.5% per year with long term inflation, again not necessarily higher because of these offsetting factors. If they do indeed sell 10+ million cars, this is roughly $600-650 billion from cars.

This leaves you with another $200-250 billion or so for other things, whatever you want to attribute this for - AI, robotaxies, insurance, and so on. Now this figure is a future value, so from today's perspective (using a discount rate of 8% used in my DCF below) that's roughly $60 billion (revenue). This is again a huge number, as it is almost another Facebook, 2x Coca-Cola etc., or half of GM/Toyota type business from revenue generating capability, again, from *today's perspective - none of which has already happened.*

Once again I want to point out that my revenue projections are not driven by bottoms-up car sales, rather, I am using simply AMZN trajectory in terms of growth, then try to attribute the resulting final revenue figure into parts, obviously majority being from car sales, and the rest from whatever you can think of. (Simply because we don't know what AI/Robos/Insurance/Transportation businesses can generate from revenue/profitability/market share perspective and more importantly what the competition in those areas can be). If you think TSLA can grow even more than AMZN, then I just want to remind you that you won't easily justify 40-50% revenue growth rates once you're in the 50+ billion zone, which is the point of the argument. AMZN, still achieved those growth rates when it had 100+ or 200+ billion, which is what we are already assuming here.

So in the stock price we have baked in, from a revenue perspective, a car business that will sell at least 10+ million cars (this number can obviously be higher but even 10 million will be big market share),  and other businesses that are worth, today, more than most companies you can think of.

Now this is the growth side of things. How about margins?

We know TSLA generated a last twelve months EBITDA margin of 14% as of Q3 2020. While margins from car manufacturing is certainly improving, most of this margin is actually attributed to sales of regulatory credits, which are by definition almost 100% profit. And so in reality, the margins are much lower, maybe around low single digits between 1-5%. Now this is important because even with all this revenue growth (and if you disagree with me and think it will even be higher), you still need to achieve big margins on your business. I mean really really good margins, we are talking about 15-25% each year. Interestingly, AMZN, while growing its top line crazily over the years and becoming a behemoth as it is today, always lacked in terms of their margins. That goes without saying they are a tech company that typically exhibit great returns on capital. So the point is they had to sacrifice their margins to be able to achieve this growth and this is an important point.

In my DCF, I am extremely generous. I kept TSLA's EBITDA margins at 15% for the next 3 years, bumped to 17.5%, 20.0%, then to finally 25.0% every 3 years in going forward. Once again these regulatory credits will not be there forever so those margins are extremely optimistic at this point. They might indeed achieve 25% margins in 10 years or so but it won't be this smooth.

With these two major factors, other items in the DCF are not super important. The discount rate is 8.0%, which I believe is reasonable, NWC and Capex assumptions are in line with what they are today and I don't think they would necessarily go down (if not go up). I just want to mention that you may completely disagree with some of the assumptions I outlined above. The point however is no matter what sort of DCF you come up with, you will end up either with lower or slight higher value for TSLA, using very, very aggressive assumptions for 10+ years. So the point and question is around the **margin of safety** here.

It seems I can't directly post pictures so here is the link for the DCF:

[https://ibb.co/mSHDcBh](https://ibb.co/mSHDcBh)

You might wonder, well your price is even higher than what it is today so why did you write this.

Once again my whole point in the argument was that the margin of error in TSLA's stock price right now is non-existent, because we've already treated it the next AMZN, gave the best margins possible, attributed big bucks on its other stuff. I think my DCF is still in the unreasonable side, but I wanted to point this out that even a s*light change in trajectory would mean a totally different path and stock price for TSLA.*

So the question is, are we ahead of ourselves with TSLA? This could also apply to others as well, this so called growth companies. It is as if we are pricing everything today and think that they have already achieved incredible market share in everything they touched and it's only a matter of time that these revenue/profits are realized. Are we taking one anomaly and applying this rationale for every other great company under the name of ""it's tech""? Elon is great and TSLA will be great. But the business model may not just allow them to be the next AMZN, regardless of technology or improvement.

One final comment I will make is related to autonomous driving and data TSLA is collecting. While it is for certain that this data gives TSLA an incredible power in developing this technology, I see couple of issues with this as it relates to future of this thing.

Companies such as Facebook are big not because of their software, but because of the network effects they exhibit. And because of those network effects they become larger and larger and are able to collect more data, which creates an incredibly profitable cycle for them as they can monetize that data right away. Data for TSLA here only matters in developing that technology. Monetization however, is another story.

What I am not entirely sure with all this AI story is that if it needs to continuously get updated for use, then how do regulators/companies determine the older version was safe to use to begin with. What I understand is that AI is something that needs to get constantly updated based on data, challenge here is that you are carrying people's lives here (as opposed to targeting ads) so there needs to be an infliction point where the full autonomous driving AI software should be at a point where it is certainly 100% safe to use. Because if it is not, then the technology fails until it reaches to that point. If it does reach out to that point, then how difficult is it going to be for others to get to that point or use similar technology if what you need is to get from point A to B safely.

Besides there is the price factor in as well. Let's say TSLA is the only one who can do this. If autonomous driving is too expensive, then how much will people pay for it? Say if the car is 50k and you have to pay extra 50k on top of that - would you do this? Would this have a cannibalization effect? Or if it is monthly subscription fees, would you go on to pay this forever? How significant will the cost be in 20 years from now when others presumably also start providing some sort of service.

On the other hand, if it is not expensive and only a fraction of the car price, then how are you going to achieve these growth levels with that data and technology to begin with. It is one thing to have a great technology, another to monetize it. They might license it for sure, but then you lose all that power right away. So the question then becomes, will it be a niche product or commodity at the end of the day - either of which will not allow you to have incredible returns.

TSLA,Reasons We May Not Be in a Bubble,3035,882,1609651162,"I'm seeing a lot of posts comparing this to the 2000 dot-com bubble. Here's a breakdown of why we're likely not anywhere close to 2000 levels of craziness.

**First:**  During the dot-com era, the Nasdaq Composite's price-to-earnings valuation ran up as high as 200. By comparison, the index's P/E today is a relatively tame 28, only modestly higher from 23 at the end of 2019. 

**Second:** Interest rates were a very attractive 6% which provided a strong alternative to stocks. No such outlet exists today unless you trust bitcoin, or want to invest in paper gold.

**Third:** Much of the value gains we're seeing in the market can be tied directly to the fact that people who invest are making similar or better money this year, and spending significantly less causing them to save more and invest more:

[https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/01/upshot/why-markets-boomed-2020.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/01/upshot/why-markets-boomed-2020.html)

**Fourth:** The rest of the growth can largely be attributed to increased liquidity from all of the money printing. Stocks tend to mirror an increase in the money supply with their value making them a great hedge against inflation. The valuations of the 2000s weren't backstopped by QE or increased savings, making them much shakier.

**Fifth:** The money printing will likely go on for a while. People mistakenly assume we're printing against our 22T dollar economy when we're really printing against the 80-100T global economy for which are the reserve currency. A weak dollar benefits the global economy, and benefits us because we are the trading floor for the global economy.

This is a long but very illuminating read on why QE is necessary and actually helpful:

[https://www.lynalden.com/fraying-petrodollar-system/](https://www.lynalden.com/fraying-petrodollar-system/)

**My Take:** There are a few stocks that are out of control with their valuations (Hi TSLA!), and a few sectors that are overvalued, but overall the market looks to be on sturdy ground with the increased savings, and the increased liquidity. There will be peaks and valleys, but I think there's a lot of room to grow, especially once the vaccine is widespread.",0.96,0,0.118035714,0.059017857,03-01-2021 05:19,129.7515564,162.8464966,87.37941742,214.9951935,235.2233276

TSLA,TSLA - Tesla market value today is more valuable than all the world's major auto makers combined - what gives?,1786,872,1609988027,"Tesla market value today (716 Billion) is about the same as  the market value of all the world's major car makers combined.  In addition China's BYDDY (86B) and Nio (78B) are both more valuable than Daimler (74B) even though NIO only delivered less than 40,000 cars in all of 2020 with huge loss. China's LI and XPEV combined market value are similar to GM (61B), which has production in China and has a worldwide lineup of EV to be on the market in the next few years.

With the exception of autonomous driving, EV manufacturing appears to have a low technology barrier to entry, that's why we have so many EV car companies pops up all over the world. Everybody used the same Total Addressable Market to justify their future value. I don't think autonomous driving is a must have in buying an EV, so the competition will be intense once all ICV companies start to produce their lineup of EVs in the near future.

Since Auto industry is a cyclical business, historically, the market value of the auto companies were somewhat depressed as compared to other high growth industries. Since there is a limit on how many cars will be sold in a year based on historical trends, I don't know how we can justify doubling or tripling the total market value of the whole auto industry unless all the non-Tesla companies lost significant amount of their market value, which is not likely (you are talking about fierce competitors like Toyota, Daimler, Honda, GM, etc)

The first movers (Tesla, BYDDY, Nio, Xpev) are catching all the investment dollars, driving their stock to current nose bleeding price.  Once all major car makers start to deliver EVs, supply and demand will determine their profit margin, future cash flow and true present value.

MSFT,I created an algo that tracks the most hyped stocks on Reddit. Here are the results for this week,3820,373,1610889192,"I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page, regardless of the subreddit, then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit.

**How is ""Hype"" calculated?**

Well, this is a little tricky but it's based on the engagement that the post received in that sub-reddit relative to other posts in the same sub-reddit

**How can I use this list?**

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. The data on this list is limited to one post per ticker. I've taken the most 'popular' post for that ticker on whichever sub-reddit it may have been. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits. Here's the data from the last week.

AMZN,I created an algo that tracks the most hyped stocks on Reddit. Here are the results for this week,3822,373,1610889192,"I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page, regardless of the subreddit, then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit.

**How is ""Hype"" calculated?**

Well, this is a little tricky but it's based on the engagement that the post received in that sub-reddit relative to other posts in the same sub-reddit

**How can I use this list?**

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. The data on this list is limited to one post per ticker. I've taken the most 'popular' post for that ticker on whichever sub-reddit it may have been. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits. Here's the data from the last week.

TSLA,I created an algo that tracks the most hyped stocks on Reddit. Here are the results for this week,4299,362,1611493796,"What's up everyone. I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit.

**How can I use this list?**

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. The data on this list is limited to one post per ticker. I've taken the most 'popular' post for that ticker on whichever sub-reddit it may have been. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits. Here's the data from the last week.

Earnings: $2.03 per share, adjusted, vs. $1.64 per share as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.

Revenue: $43.08 billion, vs. $40.18 billion as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.

Revenue from Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud business segment, which includes the Azure public cloud, server products such as Windows Server, GitHub and enterprise services, totaled $14.60 billion. That’s up 23% year over year and above the $13.77 billion consensus among analysts polled by FactSet.

Microsoft said Azure revenue grew 50%. Analysts had expected around 42% growth. Microsoft doesn’t disclose Azure revenue in dollars.

MSFT,Microsoft (MSFT) vs Intel (INTC),0,18,1611752263," We constantly compare stocks in similar sectors. Below an extract of our comparison between Microsoft and Intel

&#x200B;

One of our key metrics is the Price to Stockholders equity per share ratio. When looking at this we find the following:

* Price/Stockholders equity per share for Microsoft: 13.5
* Price/Stockholders equity per share for Intel Corp : 2.8

Based on this metric Intel Corp offers far more value than Microsoft. Most firms tend to trade at a ratio of between 2 and 5 times. While Intel trades within this range the stock if Microsoft is trading well outside this expected range. So what is the stockholders equity per share you ask? Well if a firm sells all assets, pays all its debts and distributes the rest to its stockholders, the stockholders equity per share shows what each stockholders will get. Thus the higher this ratio the less you will get out per stock compared to what you are paying for it. So Microsofit that is trading at 13.5 times it stockholders equity you will only get 7.5% of its current stock price out of they were to sell all assets, pay all debt and distribute the rest to stockholders. In the case of Intel you would get out 35.7% of its current stock price  


Next up cash as percentage of stock price:

* Cash as percentage of stock price for Microsoft: 0.81%
* Cash as percentage of stock price for Intel Corp : 2.6%

Next up lets take a look at the percentage cash on the balance sheet makes up of each group's total assets:

* Cash as percentage of stock price for Microsoft: 4.7%
* Cash as percentage of stock price for Intel Corp : 3.8%

Looking at the cash position of the three firms Microsoft has the strongest cash position (as a percentage of their total assets). The cash per share gives an indication of if investors were to buy the stock now, how much of that stock price is made up by cash on their balance sheet. In this case its Intel that comes out on top with 2.6% of their current stock price being made up by cash.   


Next the overused but still useful metric, the Price to Earnings Ratio (PE):

* PE for Microsoft:29
* PE for Intel Corp : 9.8

So  Intel has the lower PE ratio of the two firms looked at in this comparison  


Price/Stock Valuation ratio:

* Price/Stock Valuation for Microsoft: 1.27
* Price/Stock Valuation for Intel Corp : 0.76

Based on the Price/Stock valuation metric it is Intel that comes out as the winner as its trading at well below our stock price target while Microsoft is trading at well above our stock valuation for it.  


If we have to chose one of these two tech giants, based on their stock price performance, their financial results and other financial ratios we rate the stock of Intel as the **winner**.",0.46,0,0.06408046,0.03204023,27-01-2021 12:57,138.914032,161.6289978,91.31524658,225.1253204,288.0533447
AMZN,Bezos to step down as Amazon CEO - Blow out Q4,5562,878,1612300451,"Well, that was unexpected. They did have a blow out quarter though:

Q4 sales topped $100 billion for the first time:  $125.56 billion vs. $119.70 billion expected and $87.44 billion year-over-year

EPS: $14.09 vs. $7.34 expected - which is insane as well.

I'm gonna need a day to grasp this. What the hell Jeff.

Edit:  Bezos will transition to Executive Chair, and Andy Jassy will take over as CEO. Jassy is currently AWS CEO.

> “Amazon is what it is because of invention. We do crazy things together and then make them normal. We pioneered customer reviews, 1-Click, personalized recommendations, Prime’s insanely-fast shipping, Just Walk Out shopping, the Climate Pledge, Kindle, Alexa, marketplace, infrastructure cloud computing, Career Choice, and much more,” said Jeff Bezos, Amazon founder and CEO. “If you do it right, a few years after a surprising invention, the new thing has become normal. People yawn. That yawn is the greatest compliment an inventor can receive. When you look at our financial results, what you’re actually seeing are the long-run cumulative results of invention. Right now I see Amazon at its most inventive ever, making it an optimal time for this transition.”

AAPL,10 interesting and useful ETFs with less than $1b AUM,4133,499,1612445969,"I've been doing a lot of ETF research lately and wanted to share this list because I think that smaller ETFs fly under the radar all too often.  Here are 10 ETFs with less than a billion dollars under management, but that I think are interesting and possibly useful, with reasons why:

1. THNQ: ROBO Global Artificial Intelligence ETF, [https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq](https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq) .  The process-based management of THNQ's holdings targets heavy exposure to companies leading development or execution with artificial intelligence and machine learning.  My only issue with it is that for some reason they don't include Facebook in its holdings (and FB is famous with PyTorch and related work).  Competitors in this thematic space include Global X's AIQ and iShares' IRBO.  A newer ETF, THNQ has performed very, very well since inception, easily beating many other growth ETFs.  Certainly a theme to watch for the coming decade.
2. SFY: SoFi Select 500 ETF, [https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/](https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/) .  This ETF is... highly intriguing.  It has a 0.0% expense ratio, yes, free, waived until at least end of June 2021 (at which point it might go up to 0.19%).  They're waiving the fee to draw in AUM.  Its performance over the past trading year is +20%, so it beats the S&P 500 (easily).  What they do is take the top 500 US stocks by market cap, then weight them according to a set of equations based on net income and sales growth as per the methodology.  Not market-cap weighted, which is very unusual and thus nice to have as a tool in your toolkit.  The ETF ends up with more weighted overlap with the S&P 500 than other large-cap growth ETFs such as VUG, IWZ, JKE, etc., because the ""value"" companies are still in there -- they're just not weighted as highly as they are in SPY or VOO.  The usual suspects are still in the top 10: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, TSLA, GOOGL, FB.   SQ comes in at #15, which I think is very nice, and SQ is missing from an S&P 500 ETF.  Granted, if the ER wasn't 0.0%, this ETF would be significantly less attractive.  Index methodology here: [https://www.solactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solactive-SoFi-US-500-Growth-Index-Guideline.pdf](https://www.solactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solactive-SoFi-US-500-Growth-Index-Guideline.pdf)
3. DSTL: Distillate U.S. Fundamental Stability & Value ETF, [https://distillatefunds.com/dstl](https://distillatefunds.com/dstl) .  Its methodology is in the prospectus, [https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus](https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus) .  Essentially, they try to combine ""quality"" and ""value"" factor investing. The fund's weighted overlap with SPY is only 20% according to [etfrc.com](https://etfrc.com). So it's not simply the S&P. It's also not the first ETF to use free cash flow as a factor (see also: COWZ, TTAC, neither of which I really like). Its ER is only 0.39%, which is reasonably low for small-ish specialty ETFs. But how does it perform? Well, since inception over 2 years ago it has kept pace with or outperformed the S&P 500 and iShares' US quality and value factor ETFs every step of the way.  Gotta admit, I'm kinda impressed. Their top holdings right now are: JNJ, UNH, INTC, WMT, GOOGL, HD, PG, CSCO, AMGN, and AVGO. Surprisingly, compared to SPY, they're most underweight in financials. I would've thought they scored well on those cash flow metrics but maybe the banks score poorly on their debt metric and they don't compensate for banks having a different business model than, say, JNJ.  Really neat non-market-cap weighted ETF!
4. SDG: iShares MSCI Global Impact ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund) . This fund tracks an index that seeks to ""Obtain exposure to global stocks aiming to advance themes related to the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals, such as education or climate change.""  ARK Investing may also be launching an ETF with this theme in the future (see: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&t=30m53s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&t=30m53s) ).  Methodology here: [https://www.msci.com/msci-acwi-sustainable-impact-index](https://www.msci.com/msci-acwi-sustainable-impact-index) .  It's nice to have a fund you can feel good about investing in.  It has also easily outperformed the S&P 500 over the past year!
5. FRDM: Freedom 100 Emerging Markets ETF, [https://freedometfs.com/frdm/](https://freedometfs.com/frdm/) . It's a very new emerging markets ETF that is not market-cap weighted and filters countries based on human and economic freedom scores.  Top holdings include TSMC, Samsung, and CD Projekt Red.  If you're concerned about international tensions and based in North America, this could be something you'd like.  Also a rare way to get very high weight to tech outside China in an emerging markets ETF.  Very unusual and a neat tool to have in your emerging markets investing toolbox!
6. EMXC: iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex China ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund) . Also an ex-China emerging markets fund, but otherwise it follows a broad MSCI mark-cap weighted index.  Very top-heavy in Korea, Taiwan, India, and Brazil.  It's another tool to stay in emerging markets but specifically tailor your China exposure through some other portfolio choice (or have none at all).  Like in FRDM, you get heavy exposure to TSMC and Samsung.
7. IMTM: iShares MSCI Intl Momentum Factor ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf) .  One of the few ways to get exposure to trending stocks in developed non-US markets.  Really heavy on tech and luxury.  If you're bored of holding EFA or VEA and want greater returns from non-US developed markets, check this out, it may be something you like.  High exposure to Shopify, Sony, Nintendo, LVMH.
8. SWAN: AMPLIFY BLACKSWAN GROWTH & TREASURY CORE ETF, [https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html](https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html) .  Treasuries plus SPY LEAP options.  Its performance in 2020 was great -- saved you during the crash, and gets you most of the S&P 500 upside during ""normal"" times.  Kind of a barbell strategy; an interesting conservative ETF.  Probably of greater interest to people near or in retirement.  Amplify has a whole set of thematic ETFs, much like Global X.
9. NTSX: WisdomTree 90/60 U.S. Balanced Fund, [https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx](https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx) .  Another fund that deals with both US large caps and treasuries.  But in this case, it uses treasury futures as leveraged exposure to get 90% equities, 60% treasuries total exposure.  Quite a clever package and designed for long-term holding with reduced volatility, while likely outperforming a 60/40 balanced fund.  There's a huge thread on bogleheads.org about it with a lot of people who like its design.
10. IGBH: iShares Interest Rate Hedged Long-Term Corporate Bond ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf) .  This is an interest-rate hedged long-term corporate bond ETF.  You see, when treasury yields rise, as is expected the next year or two, corporate bond yields also rise.  But that means the price of the bonds goes down -- bad for bond ETF values.  Hedging the rates allows you to still collect distributions and have lower volatility than equities, but avoid the interest-rate risk.  A whole lot of money has flowed into this and its sister ETF, LQDH, in the past 6 months because of historically low treasury yields.

ok, here's a bonus #11:

11. PPA: Invesco Aerospace & Defense ETF, [https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PPA](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PPA) .  This is a broad defense industry ETF, and may have some deep value right now as the industry has lagged for the past year.  But the world is still a dangerous place and if war breaks out these companies will benefit; a good ETF to have watchlisted.  US and allied defense spending keeps chugging along.  Also, many of these companies may be in Cathie Wood's ARKX. ITA is an alternative but lacks $HON, which is an important company in the sector.

Disclaimer: this is not financial advice and I currently have no position in any of those ETFs at time of posting, but that may change at any point in the future.

What do you guys think?  Any of those look like something you might invest in?  Anyone else want to comment on a personal favorite small/medium sized fund?

MSFT,10 interesting and useful ETFs with less than $1b AUM,4135,499,1612445969,"I've been doing a lot of ETF research lately and wanted to share this list because I think that smaller ETFs fly under the radar all too often.  Here are 10 ETFs with less than a billion dollars under management, but that I think are interesting and possibly useful, with reasons why:

1. THNQ: ROBO Global Artificial Intelligence ETF, [https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq](https://roboglobaletfs.com/thnq) .  The process-based management of THNQ's holdings targets heavy exposure to companies leading development or execution with artificial intelligence and machine learning.  My only issue with it is that for some reason they don't include Facebook in its holdings (and FB is famous with PyTorch and related work).  Competitors in this thematic space include Global X's AIQ and iShares' IRBO.  A newer ETF, THNQ has performed very, very well since inception, easily beating many other growth ETFs.  Certainly a theme to watch for the coming decade.
2. SFY: SoFi Select 500 ETF, [https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/](https://www.sofi.com/invest/etfs/sfy/) .  This ETF is... highly intriguing.  It has a 0.0% expense ratio, yes, free, waived until at least end of June 2021 (at which point it might go up to 0.19%).  They're waiving the fee to draw in AUM.  Its performance over the past trading year is +20%, so it beats the S&P 500 (easily).  What they do is take the top 500 US stocks by market cap, then weight them according to a set of equations based on net income and sales growth as per the methodology.  Not market-cap weighted, which is very unusual and thus nice to have as a tool in your toolkit.  The ETF ends up with more weighted overlap with the S&P 500 than other large-cap growth ETFs such as VUG, IWZ, JKE, etc., because the ""value"" companies are still in there -- they're just not weighted as highly as they are in SPY or VOO.  The usual suspects are still in the top 10: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, TSLA, GOOGL, FB.   SQ comes in at #15, which I think is very nice, and SQ is missing from an S&P 500 ETF.  Granted, if the ER wasn't 0.0%, this ETF would be significantly less attractive.  Index methodology here: [https://www.solactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solactive-SoFi-US-500-Growth-Index-Guideline.pdf](https://www.solactive.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Solactive-SoFi-US-500-Growth-Index-Guideline.pdf)
3. DSTL: Distillate U.S. Fundamental Stability & Value ETF, [https://distillatefunds.com/dstl](https://distillatefunds.com/dstl) .  Its methodology is in the prospectus, [https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus](https://distillatefunds.com/dstl/prospectus) .  Essentially, they try to combine ""quality"" and ""value"" factor investing. The fund's weighted overlap with SPY is only 20% according to [etfrc.com](https://etfrc.com). So it's not simply the S&P. It's also not the first ETF to use free cash flow as a factor (see also: COWZ, TTAC, neither of which I really like). Its ER is only 0.39%, which is reasonably low for small-ish specialty ETFs. But how does it perform? Well, since inception over 2 years ago it has kept pace with or outperformed the S&P 500 and iShares' US quality and value factor ETFs every step of the way.  Gotta admit, I'm kinda impressed. Their top holdings right now are: JNJ, UNH, INTC, WMT, GOOGL, HD, PG, CSCO, AMGN, and AVGO. Surprisingly, compared to SPY, they're most underweight in financials. I would've thought they scored well on those cash flow metrics but maybe the banks score poorly on their debt metric and they don't compensate for banks having a different business model than, say, JNJ.  Really neat non-market-cap weighted ETF!
4. SDG: iShares MSCI Global Impact ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/283378/ishares-msci-global-impact-etf-fund) . This fund tracks an index that seeks to ""Obtain exposure to global stocks aiming to advance themes related to the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals, such as education or climate change.""  ARK Investing may also be launching an ETF with this theme in the future (see: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&t=30m53s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfhgbZBWgBE&t=30m53s) ).  Methodology here: [https://www.msci.com/msci-acwi-sustainable-impact-index](https://www.msci.com/msci-acwi-sustainable-impact-index) .  It's nice to have a fund you can feel good about investing in.  It has also easily outperformed the S&P 500 over the past year!
5. FRDM: Freedom 100 Emerging Markets ETF, [https://freedometfs.com/frdm/](https://freedometfs.com/frdm/) . It's a very new emerging markets ETF that is not market-cap weighted and filters countries based on human and economic freedom scores.  Top holdings include TSMC, Samsung, and CD Projekt Red.  If you're concerned about international tensions and based in North America, this could be something you'd like.  Also a rare way to get very high weight to tech outside China in an emerging markets ETF.  Very unusual and a neat tool to have in your emerging markets investing toolbox!
6. EMXC: iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex China ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/288504/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-ex-china-etf-fund) . Also an ex-China emerging markets fund, but otherwise it follows a broad MSCI mark-cap weighted index.  Very top-heavy in Korea, Taiwan, India, and Brazil.  It's another tool to stay in emerging markets but specifically tailor your China exposure through some other portfolio choice (or have none at all).  Like in FRDM, you get heavy exposure to TSMC and Samsung.
7. IMTM: iShares MSCI Intl Momentum Factor ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/271538/ishares-msci-international-developed-momentum-factor-etf) .  One of the few ways to get exposure to trending stocks in developed non-US markets.  Really heavy on tech and luxury.  If you're bored of holding EFA or VEA and want greater returns from non-US developed markets, check this out, it may be something you like.  High exposure to Shopify, Sony, Nintendo, LVMH.
8. SWAN: AMPLIFY BLACKSWAN GROWTH & TREASURY CORE ETF, [https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html](https://amplifyetfs.com/swan.html) .  Treasuries plus SPY LEAP options.  Its performance in 2020 was great -- saved you during the crash, and gets you most of the S&P 500 upside during ""normal"" times.  Kind of a barbell strategy; an interesting conservative ETF.  Probably of greater interest to people near or in retirement.  Amplify has a whole set of thematic ETFs, much like Global X.
9. NTSX: WisdomTree 90/60 U.S. Balanced Fund, [https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx](https://www.wisdomtree.com/etfs/asset-allocation/ntsx) .  Another fund that deals with both US large caps and treasuries.  But in this case, it uses treasury futures as leveraged exposure to get 90% equities, 60% treasuries total exposure.  Quite a clever package and designed for long-term holding with reduced volatility, while likely outperforming a 60/40 balanced fund.  There's a huge thread on bogleheads.org about it with a lot of people who like its design.
10. IGBH: iShares Interest Rate Hedged Long-Term Corporate Bond ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf) .  This is an interest-rate hedged long-term corporate bond ETF.  You see, when treasury yields rise, as is expected the next year or two, corporate bond yields also rise.  But that means the price of the bonds goes down -- bad for bond ETF values.  Hedging the rates allows you to still collect distributions and have lower volatility than equities, but avoid the interest-rate risk.  A whole lot of money has flowed into this and its sister ETF, LQDH, in the past 6 months because of historically low treasury yields.

ok, here's a bonus #11:

11. PPA: Invesco Aerospace & Defense ETF, [https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PPA](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PPA) .  This is a broad defense industry ETF, and may have some deep value right now as the industry has lagged for the past year.  But the world is still a dangerous place and if war breaks out these companies will benefit; a good ETF to have watchlisted.  US and allied defense spending keeps chugging along.  Also, many of these companies may be in Cathie Wood's ARKX. ITA is an alternative but lacks $HON, which is an important company in the sector.

Disclaimer: this is not financial advice and I currently have no position in any of those ETFs at time of posting, but that may change at any point in the future.

What do you guys think?  Any of those look like something you might invest in?  Anyone else want to comment on a personal favorite small/medium sized fund?

Quite a clever package and designed for long-term holding with reduced volatility, while likely outperforming a 60/40 balanced fund.  There's a huge thread on bogleheads.org about it with a lot of people who like its design.
10. IGBH: iShares Interest Rate Hedged Long-Term Corporate Bond ETF, [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/275397/ishares-interest-rate-hedged-10-year-credit-bond-etf) .  This is an interest-rate hedged long-term corporate bond ETF.  You see, when treasury yields rise, as is expected the next year or two, corporate bond yields also rise.  But that means the price of the bonds goes down -- bad for bond ETF values.  Hedging the rates allows you to still collect distributions and have lower volatility than equities, but avoid the interest-rate risk.  A whole lot of money has flowed into this and its sister ETF, LQDH, in the past 6 months because of historically low treasury yields.

ok, here's a bonus #11:

11. PPA: Invesco Aerospace & Defense ETF, [https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PPA](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=PPA) .  This is a broad defense industry ETF, and may have some deep value right now as the industry has lagged for the past year.  But the world is still a dangerous place and if war breaks out these companies will benefit; a good ETF to have watchlisted.  US and allied defense spending keeps chugging along.  Also, many of these companies may be in Cathie Wood's ARKX. ITA is an alternative but lacks $HON, which is an important company in the sector.

Disclaimer: this is not financial advice and I currently have no position in any of those ETFs at time of posting, but that may change at any point in the future.

What do you guys think?  Any of those look like something you might invest in?  Anyone else want to comment on a personal favorite small/medium sized fund?

MSFT,Second Quarter Results: 6 months into the /r/investing underrated stock survey and the average return was 72% (37% as a portfolio),752,311,1612873399,"Building on a previous post ([http://redd.it/i2thge/](http://redd.it/i2thge/)) asking the community to pick underrated stocks, there was interest in seeing the quarterly performance of everyone's picks

The first quarter can be seen here: [http://redd.it/jti14m/](http://redd.it/jti14m/)

For this quarter, the key takeaways are as follows:

* Overall average return of 72.2% (driven by the GME pick)
* If you invested equally in each stock, returns would have been 41.9%, or if you bought one of each stock, returns would have been 37.5%
* 86% of the 254 picks have shown a positive return, with 80% greater than 10% return and 20% greater than 100% return
* Highest returning pick: Gamestock (GME) at 1342% flagged by  /u/EmployerOfTheMonth, to which they stated *""If it goes up, people will think I'm some sort genius for going against the crowd, if it goes down, people will just mindly brush me off as a moron for actually thinking this was underrated""*
* If you invested in the top 5 most upvoted stocks (NET, CRSP, STNE, NVDA, NOK), you would have seen an average return of 62%
* If you invested in the top 5 most controversial stocks (TSLA, WD, AMD, LMND, UBER), you would have seen a return of 93%
* If you had invested equally in the stocks with greater than 10% return in the first 30 days, your total return would be 53.1%

In graphical format, you can also see the results here: [https://i.imgur.com/CzEYTxv.png](https://i.imgur.com/CzEYTxv.png)

With that said, it feels as though in Amazon’s case most articles examining their valuation is based solely on the retail site and AWS. Sure, those account for the majority of income today, but they’re investing heavily in markets with incredibly high caps and have a very good chance of being major players due to their size, lobbying ability, and track record. Ie) Amazon Health Care, Zoox (autonomous taxi), Amazon Fresh (brick & mortar grocery), just to name a few. And, with everyone one of these business they cross-sell their others.

TSLA,Elon Musk believes Bill Gates had a big short position on Tesla (TSLA) and lost a lot of money,650,308,1613165830,"Elon Musk revealed that he has heard that Bill Gates had a big short position on Tesla (TSLA), and he might have lost a lot of money on it.


 
Billionaires Musk and Gates don’t always have good words to say about each other, but they do appear to share similar concerns about climate change.

However, Gates made some strange comments about electrification last year, including that electric trucks, like the Tesla Semi, and electric airplanes will “probably never” work.

In a new interview on the Joe Rogan Experience, Musk was asked about those comments from gates.

Tesla’s CEO responded:

“He didn’t know what he was talking about. Probably somebody told him that and he is just not that close to the physics of it. I don’t think he is ill-intentioned here, I just think he doesn’t know what he is talking about.”

He added Tesla already has working prototypes of electric trucks that are transporting cargo – something that we already pointed out in our original report about Gates’ comment, including the fact that not only Tesla has working electric semi truck programs, but also other automakers like Daimler.

But then Musk revealed that he has heard that Gates was betting against Tesla with a large short position:

“I also heard that at one point he had a large short position. I don’t know if that’s true or not, but it seems weird. People I know who know the situation pretty well, I asked them “are you sure?” and they said “yes, he has a huge short position on Tesla”. That didn’t work out too well.”

We have reached out to Gates’ foundation to see if we could get a comment on Musk’s claim, and we will update if we get an answer.

Tesla has sometimes been the most shorted stock on the NASDAQ, and people who bet against the electric automaker lost $38 billion in 2020.

TSLA,"Why Cathie Wood might be right, and why TSLA is actually STILL fairly or even undervalued at these levels.",312,485,1613171682,"""Analysts have been calling the stock “overvalued” since the day they went public, because they all keep comparing it to other car companies. I wish I had a dollar for every analyst who pointed out how “*every other car company sells ten times as many cars*”. 

 I’ve also repeatedly bumped into some lazy analysis that Tesla is expensive because its current P/E is 1,270x or forward P/E is 204x. However, I’ve hardly ever seen a Tesla bear put out a detailed valuation in support of their bearish thesis which makes me wonder if a lot of people are simply dismissing Tesla in arrogance.

But the thing is, they’re all making the same mistake:

**Tesla isn’t a car company.**

They’re an energy and technology and SaaS company that makes cars.

Once you realize what Tesla really is, you start to see what their place in the market is going to be in the years to come.

They acquired Grohmann Engineering. They acquired Perbox. They acquired Maxwell Technologies and Hibar Systems. And of course everyone remembers the Solar City acquisition back before dropping Motors from their name. They didn’t acquire these companies because they thought they were cool. They did it so nobody else could.

* There are 25,000 EV charging stations in the United States. 20,000 of them are owned by Tesla.
* Tesla is currently the #1 li-ion battery manufacturer in America, and #5 in the world.
* Tesla has secured the rights to large supplies of lithium, and has developed their own internal process for extracting lithium deposits inexpensively from other sources.

These segments of the energy space — battery production and EV charging — are a market sector that’s going to grow 50 fold in the next 15 years as consumer demand for EV’s increases. All of the major auto manufacturers have declared they’re shifting towards electric cars.

Where are they going to get the batteries? How are their customers going to charge them?

The answer: Tesla.

Musk has made it clear from the beginning that their intent is to supply batteries for the entire EV *industry*, not just their own cars, and has also more or less come out and said that he’s open to letting other auto manufacturers access their Supercharger network. That puts them squarely in the energy business as the single most capable distributor.

There’s also been chatter about licensing their self-driving technology, and using their self-driving technology as a recurring revenue generation, which would be a very attractive value-add for the other OEM’s. And all of these things don’t even begin to cover the expected growth in residential energy with products like rooftop solar, Powerwall, etc.""

I couldn't find a source whether they fully made the purchase  prior to the announcement or after. So let say  TSLA's avg is 40k. 1.5 billion would give them 37.5k Bitcoins.

As of today, it hit 50k just for a slight nano second. The valuation of 37.5k BTC is 1.875 billion at 50k PER...


This doesn't account for the TSLA sales with BTC and also 40k avg i would say falls around the higher average side.

TSLA,JPMorgan advises clients to expose 1% of their portfolio to Bitcoin,4758,1753,1614373174,"In a recent note to clients, strategists from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) suggested a one percent portfolio allocation to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

As reported by Bloomberg, JPM strategists Joyce Chang and Amy Ho opined that Bitcoin could serve as a hedge against fluctuations from traditional assets like bonds, stocks, and commodities. However, they advised clients to allocate a small percentage due to the risk of major downturns in Bitcoin’s value.

After setting a new all-time high above $58,000, the value of the digital asset slumped to less than $45,000 and has been struggling to recover ever since.

Chang and Ho told investors:

>*In a multi-asset portfolio, investors can likely add up to 1% of their allocation to cryptocurrencies in order to achieve any efficiency gain in the overall risk-adjusted returns of the portfolio.*

Bitcoin has welcomed major investments from the likes of Paul Tudor Jones, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), and MicroStrategy. The endorsement from JPM comes at a time when institutional players are rushing to accumulate the digital asset. As per Bloomberg’s report, America’s oldest bank BNY Mellon (NYSE:BK) has also announced plans to enable Bitcoin transactions for its clients.

The strategists were quick to add that cryptocurrencies should be viewed as an investment vehicle and opposed to being funding currencies like the USD or EUR. This appears to be contrary to earlier statements from other JPM analysts that called cryptocurrencies the “poorest hedge for major drawdowns in equities.”

TSLA,A message to all the TSLA and NIO and general investors that are selling out and panicking.,275,216,1614801786,"First off. Lmao. Cant tell you how many times I’ve been called a “boomer” for avoiding TSLA and NIO. For the people that are still holding on, good on you.....but the people panicked and selling at a loss, yikes. 

It’s times like this where we learn the most about ourselves. 

- Ask yourself what you’ve learned about your risk tolerance. 

- Ask yourself what lessons you’ve learned about the reason why you are investing and buying companies. 

When the market goes down or one of my holdings tank. I am often reminded of Peter Lynch. He says that when you buy a company because the returns are good, when the stock goes down people don’t know what to do and sell. I feel like this is a lot of y’all. Y’all bought TSLA and NIO in hopes of 7xing your money...but now that TSLA is down 25% from its ATH, and NIO is down 33%; y’all don’t know what to do, so you panic and then sell. 

About a month ago, I found this article by Financial Samurai 

https://www.financialsamurai.com/risk-tolerance-is-difficult-to-measure/

I think he shares an important lesson/warning about investing. Your perceived risk tolerance is an illusion. The truth is, most of y’all (including myself) have never experienced major crashes. I know a good chunk of y’all probably started in 2020 and only experienced 2020 style returns, let me tell you that isn’t normal. 

It’s easy to say “buy and hold forever!!!” And I assume most, if not all of you say that because it’s common advice and common sense, however we all have a plan until SHTF as the saying goes. 

It’s important to keep a level head when it comes to investing. Buffett always preaches that investing doesn’t take smarts, it takes guts. You can put all your money into VOO and have good returns, but if you can’t stomach crashes/corrections and sell, then you won’t make money. 

Personal way of dealing with this: 

When it comes to volatility, I’ve experienced some large 20% plus drops in prices and have held on. It’s hard but I’ve held on and bought more during those dips because I believe in what I’m buying and know why I am buying it. I’ve done my DD over the companies I’m in and that gives me the confidence I need to keep going. What helps me, is not looking. I’ll delete the app or turn off my computer and make myself busy. This helped me the most last spring, I used to watch it like a hawk when things would dip and I’d start to panic and think about selling. When I turn it off, that impulse goes away some. What also helped me was, before I buy anything I write down on a Word Doc, why I’m buying it; and before I sell, I write down and explain what factors changed that makes me need to sell the stock, if nothing changed, I know I’m being irrational and I need to buy the dip. 

So these are just my observations. Not professional financial advice but the tips are what I personally do.",0.88,0.05,0.214424734,0.132212367,03-03-2021 20:03,119.5353394,150.25,101.0872498,220.4702301,217.7333374

For much of its’ history, Ford ($F) has been a boring dividend stock, yielding between 5% and 10% per year and generally languishing between $5 and $15 a share. Not exactly an inspiring story of growth or innovation. In a sector that hosts charismatic CEOs, exciting newcomers, and glossy new entrants to the industry, selling people on Ford’s potential certainly seems like an uphill battle. I mean… just look at their all-time chart, Ford hasn’t had meaningful sustained price movement since 00-01, and that was in the wrong direction.

I would like you to forget what you think you know about Ford and begin to look at them in a new light. Ford is no longer the ugly girl at the dance or the fat kid in gym class, but rather Ryan Reynolds in *Just Friends* or Laney Boggs in *She’s All That*. To understand why I think Ford is the most compelling value opportunity in the auto sector today, we’re going to have to look at its maneuverings over the last 3-4 years.

# New Leadership, New Vision

**$11B Restructuring Plan**

In October of 2020, Ford hired its’ new [CEO Jim Farley](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/people/james-d--farley--jr-.html) who had previously held the title of COO within the company. Farley was the architect behind the company’s [$11B restructuring plan](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2018/11/26/ford-statement-on-business-transformation.html) that it announced in June of 2018, and it has only accelerated its’ pace under his guidance. By most estimates Ford is about halfway through its plan to restructure the company, which primarily involves cuts to unprofitable sectors and refocusing on profitable ones, as well as investment in future technologies.

**Trimming of Fat**

Ford has made a few major moves to shore up losses it was incurring in unprofitable arms of the business. The first, and one which you are probably already aware of, is the discontinuation of many of its sedan lineup in North America. In the middle of 2018, Ford announced that it would be [eliminating the Taurus, Fiesta, Fusion, C-Max, and Focus sedans](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/ford/2018/04/25/ford-cutting-car-lineup-earnings/34244867/) from their lineup moving forward. The estimated operating cost savings was $25.5B through 2022, and Ford announced that they would be focusing on their more profitable SUV and pick-up models moving forward.

Ford also announced in 2021 that it would be largely [exiting the South American market](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/01/11/ford-advances-south-america-restructuring.html), which hadn’t turned a profit since 2012 and in fact accounted for over $5B in losses during that period. They would continue operating at small-scale producing their popular Ranger pick-up and commercial vans but with the closure of their main manufacturing facility in Brazil, Ford finally cut bait in a difficult market for most traditional automakers.

Ford Europe had a [major redesign](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/feu/en/news/2019/06/27/ford-looks-to-the-future-in-europe--business-redesigned-for-prof.html) under Farley when he was President of Global Markets, slashing underperforming models from its lineup and refocusing on its highly profitable commercial vehicles as well as increasing imports of its iconic models. They also announced a [strong shift toward EVs](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/feu/en/news/2021/02/17/ford-europe-goes-all-in-on-evs-on-road-to-sustainable-profitabil.html) with the goal of selling only electric vehicles in Europe by 2030.

**EV Investment**

Here is the section everyone is interested in, and one which GM rightly received a lot of hype for when they announced a [plan to spend $27B on developing EVs](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/19/gm-accelerating-ev-plans-with-additional-7-billion-announces-new-pickup.html) and autonomous vehicles by 2025. After that announcement, GM was viewed by many as the front-runner for EVs among traditional automakers. Not to be outdone, Ford announced a [$29B investment in EVs](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/02/04/ford-raises-planned-investment-ev-av-leadership.html) and autonomous vehicles to be spent by 2025. To date, that is the third largest investment in EVs in the world, only falling short of the $86B and $87B investments by the mega-conglomerates VW and HMG respectively.

**Revival of Valuable IP**

In the last few years, Ford has refocused much of their business on their greatest hits. They’ve cut unpopular IP from their lineup and re-released the Bronco as well as reworked the Mustang into a crossover EV. In my opinion, this demonstrates a greater understanding of their markets and how to capitalize on their most valuable asset, which is their IP. Their most profitable model, the F-150, will be released as an EV in 2022 or 2023, and I expect that the Bronco will also see an EV model in the next few years as well. I believe that Ford has become a leaner and more focused company within the last 3 years and is set to continue their dominance in pick-ups as well as siphon significant market share in the EV and SUV spaces.

# The Power of Partnerships

**Ford, VW, and Argo**

Ford, along with fellow automotive titan Volkswagen Group, have both taken [large stakes](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2020/06/02/volkswagen-investment-argo-ai-ford-self-driving.html) in a company dedicated to autonomous driving software called Argo AI. Partnering with a company with considerable resources like VW takes some of the pressure off of Ford to develop this technology solo. While there haven’t been too many details released about this partnership or the progress being made by Argo AI, it is reassuring to know that Ford is actively invested in developing autonomous driving along with another industry leader in VW.

**Ford and Google**

In February of 2021, Ford and Google announced a [partnership](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/02/01/ford-google-accelerate-auto-innovation.html) to place Google’s software and technology in all of Ford’s new vehicles beginning in 2023. The operating platform in these new vehicles will be based off of the Android platform and all new vehicles will come equipped with Alphabet products like Google Cloud, Google Maps, Google Assistant, and the Play Store. The addition of a familiar and established operating system like Android will give Ford vehicles a competitive edge over other automakers who try to create and implement their own subpar operating software (\*cough\* Toyota \*cough\*).

**Ford and Rivian**

Ford made headlines in April 2019 when they invested in Rivian for an undisclosed stake. What is clear from statements made by both CEO’s at the time is that the investment was both for equity as well as a strategic partnership. A planned vehicle by Ford, which has yet to be announced, will be built on Rivian’s unique [“skateboard”](https://www.forbes.com/sites/edgarsten/2019/04/24/ford-jumps-on-rivians-skateboard/?sh=215fbc2d23ef) platform. This platform consists of “a flat frame that contains the batteries, suspension, motors and braking” on which the cab rests, and theoretically cuts costs in the manufacturing of EVs due to fewer overall parts in assembly. I suspect that this may be the platform used in the inevitable Bronco EV release, due to the striking similarities in the size and styling of the Bronco and the Rivian R1S. It is also possible that Ford may release an entirely new model on the platform, but that is just my hunch.

The equity stake in Rivian was undisclosed, but I expect that that stake may be worth [between $2B and $5B](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/23/rivian-scores-1point3-billion-investment-from-trowe-price-others.html) based on the valuation of Rivian at time of investment (\~$5B-7B) and now (\~$30B-$50B). This equity stake and strategic partnership will serve Ford well in their future development in the EV market.

# Financials and Valuation

**Financial Overview**

2020 was a tough year for many industries and the auto sector was no exception. Ford had 4 consecutive quarters of negative EPS, their YOY revenue fell by almost 20% when compared to 2019, and they had to eliminate their dividend in March 2020 for the first time since 2009 when it was eliminated during the Great Recession, before being reinstated in 2012. So where does this leave Ford now?

Despite the blow to revenue in 2020, Ford is emerging leaner and better equipped to dominate the market in 2021 and beyond. Revenue decreased 20% in 2020, and Ford had to take on significant new debt to continue financing operations. However that appears to be true for most other major automakers during the pandemic, so I don’t expect this to be a major factor in determining which automakers will be most successful in the future. I expect that 2021 will be a blockbuster year for Ford as revenues increase to pre-pandemic levels (I expect higher earnings in Q3 and Q4), and they continue to develop the most profitable arms of their business.

**Dividend Reinstatement**

GM and Ford both eliminated their dividends to survive the pandemic in March 2020, however there is widespread expectation that they will reinstate them sometime this year as revenue begins to pick back up. I personally view this as an incentive to buy Ford before the announcement. If they reinstate their .60 yearly dividend, it would amount to a \~5% annual yield based on the current stock price of 13.37. I expect that the return of their dividend will also attract the return of investors who value dividend stocks which may push the price up further all on its own. I believe this is a mini-catalyst for short term price movement for Ford, and collecting on the dividend won’t hurt either.

**Comparison to Other Traditional Automakers**

Generally, I like to look at 4 different ratios to quickly judge the valuation of a company compared to their peers in the same industry. Lets compare Ford’s numbers to their closest 5 competitors (Toyota, Honda, VW, GM, Daimler) to get a sense of how fairly they are currently valued. I’m avoiding comparing Ford to newcomers like TSLA, NIO, etc. because frankly the numbers aren’t comparable. Financial data was gathered from Finviz and Yahoo Finance.

Quick definitions of the ratios, with respect to current valuation:

P/S = Share price/Sales per Share (Lower is better)

Forward P/E = Share price/(Estimated net profit for next year/# of outstanding shares) (Lower is better)

Debt-to-Equity = Total debt/shareholder equity (Lower is better)

Current Ratio = Current assets/Current liabilities over the next year (Higher is better)

Price to Book = Share price/Book value per share (Lower is better)

|**Ratio**|**Ford**|**Toyota**|**Honda**|**VW**|**GM**|**Daimler**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|P/S|0.39|0.99|0.45|0.53|0.66|0.50|
|Forward PE|8.64|12.92|9.24|10.67|9.49|8.87|
|Debt/Equity|5.27|1.10|0.97|1.71|2.44|2.60|
|Current Ratio|1.20|1.10|1.30|1.12|1.00|1.15|
|P/B|1.73|1.05|0.67|0.80|1.89|1.27|

&#x200B;

As you can see, Ford has noticeable strengths and weaknesses when it comes to valuation. Strictly looking at revenue metrics like P/S and P/E, Ford is the most undervalued company on this list. They do however carry the largest debt burden of all of the listed companies, so that is something to keep in mind. I’m not particularly worried about their debt situation, as their Current Ratio at 1.20 indicates that they are in no present danger of being crushed by their debt, and I expect that strong future revenue will allow them to dig themselves out of that hole.

Compared to GM, who I believe to be their closest competitor, they are trading at a much lower revenue multiple (0.39 vs 0.66). Even accounting for Ford’s higher debt burden, I believe they should be trading closer to a 0.50 multiple, which puts them more in line with other traditional automakers.

My personal price target: **$17.14/share**

# 2021 Outlook

**Massive Demand**

Ford’s most recent releases the 2021 F-150, the 2021 Bronco Sport, and the 2021 Mustang Mach-E are all flying off dealer’s lots at [record pace](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/05/demand-looks-very-high-for-fords-tesla-fighting-mu/). The auto industry quantifies demand with a specific metric called Time to Turn. This is a measure of how long a vehicle sits on the lot before it is purchased. The industry average Time to Turn is somewhere [around 60 or 70 days](https://www.edmunds.com/car-news/auto-industry/new-vehicle-inventory-swells-in-february.html) for new vehicles. Anything under 20 days generally indicates that a specific model is in very high demand. I’ll list the Time to Turn for Ford’s three new models in 2021 below:

2021 Ford F-150: 9 days

2021 Bronco Sport: 13 days

2021 Mustang Mach-E: 4 days (!!!)

As you can see Ford’s recent releases have been massive successes so far, and I expect that as the economy continues to recover from the pandemic that demand will only continue to rise for these models.

**7500 tax credit availability**

Remember that $7500 federal tax credit that everyone was all excited about when EVs first went to market in the U.S.? Me neither. The reason you may not have heard about this tax credit in awhile is probably due to the fact that the biggest seller of EVs (Tesla) is [no longer eligible](https://www.cars.com/articles/tesla-tax-credit-is-expiring-heres-everything-shoppers-need-to-know-1420700959540/) to receive the credit for purchases of their vehicles. The second biggest seller (GM) is about to lose eligibility at the end of this month.

The way this program works is that an auto manufacturer is eligible for the credit for their first 200,000 vehicles sold in the U.S. After that, they are only eligible for state-level tax credits which tend to be much smaller if they exist at all. To date, Ford has only sold a measly 10,000 EVs total in the U.S with around 5,000 of their largely unsuccessful Focus EV and 5,000 of their new 2021 Mach-E. That means they have an enormous 190,000 vehicles left for which their purchasers can be incentivized by the tax credit. In my opinion this gives Ford a massive advantage over their closest competitors (GM and Tesla), and in fact, we are already seeing Ford stealing market share directly from Tesla as it appears that [nearly 100% of Tesla’s recent loss in market share is attributable to Ford](https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/04/business/ford-mustang-mach-e-tesla-market-share/index.html).

Bear Case

**Chip Shortage**

As I’m sure you’ve heard by now, semiconductor shortages are projected to be a [massive problem](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/03/01/semiconductor-shortage-halts-auto-factories/) for the auto industry as a whole. Recent estimates put nearly[1 million](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3662459-auto-chip-shortage-could-impact-1-million-vehicles-in-q1) new vehicles affected by the shortage in Q1 2021 alone across the entire auto sector. Ford has already had to cut shifts at some of their manufacturing plants because they cannot secure enough chips to produce as many vehicles as they’d like. A few automakers like Toyota and Hyundai had the foresight to maintain their semiconductor supply, and thus their 2021 production will not be affected. The chip shortage will surely cut Ford’s top-line revenue, and it is not expected to ease until late 2021 at the earliest.

**Battery Supplier Issues**

In February 2021, the U.S. International Trade Commission [ruled against battery supplier SK Innovation](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lg-chem-sk-innovation-ford/u-s-itc-criticizes-ford-for-pursuing-sk-innovation-battery-deals-idUSKBN2AX00Z) in their patent battle with competitor LG Chem. SK Innovation is the contracted supplier for batteries for the planned F-150 EV. This caused reasonable consternation among investors who were worried that the F-150 production timeline could be affected. Buried in the ruling however, was a stipulation that SK Innovation could continue to supply Ford with batteries for the F-150 through 2025, which should give Ford time to shift to a new supplier. There is always a chance that the Biden administration overrules the ITC in favor of securing greater production capability for the U.S. Nevertheless, this represents a hurdle that Ford will have to address in the future.

**Debt Burden**

There’s no way to sugar coat it, Ford has a ton of debt. They were a relatively debt heavy company prior to the pandemic, and that has only become worse. If you look at the company comparisons done above you can see the relatively high debt-to-equity ratio that ford carries compared to other automakers. The good news is that much of that debt isn’t due in the near future and Ford’s outlook is due to improve significantly from the disaster that was 2020.

**New Competition (Tesla, Lucid, Rivian, Etc.)**

This post has already become obscenely long so I’m not going to go into great detail here. You’ve all heard of these companies and how they intend to disrupt the auto sector, costing traditional automakers market share. There is no doubt that there are more players on the field these days, and Ford and GM will not have a virtual monopoly on the American market anymore. I personally only have high hopes for a few of the newcomers, but they still represent one more obstacle on Ford’s path to success.

**Closing**

I believe that Ford is currently undervalued and is ready to succeed as a leader in EVs in the future. This does not mean that investing in Ford is a sure thing; parts shortages, a high debt burden, and emerging competition all represent serious threats to Ford’s core business. Nonetheless, I am confident in Ford’s future prospects and consider them to be a strong buy as a long-term investment.

* **Quantum Computing**
   * **IonQ - $DMYI**
      * A quick introduction to QC: a normal computer exists of bytes, so 0 OR 1, a QC has qubits, so possibly 0 AND 1 at the same time. In theory this will improve the computational power of computers in a massive way and therefore QC wil be able to solve different classes of problems
      * The qubits that make up QCs are prone to error given the fragile nature of the quantum states. There are 2 quantum states: ion trap (IonQ, Honeywell) and superconducting qubits (IBM, Google). These have about a 0.5% chance of an error during a so-called 2-qubit gate operation ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum\_logic\_gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate)), thus limiting the complexity of the computation you will be able to do.
      * So a lot of research is being done to improve these physical error rates, but an improvement of more than 0.01% seems to be difficult.  This is where error correction becomes important. People have come up with error correction codes that can tolerate error rates and create a much lower error rate by creating what's called a logical qubit. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical\_and\_logical\_qubits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_and_logical_qubits)).
      * It takes a lot of physical qubits to make 1 single logical qubit.  Most researchers believe that with a few hundred to a few thousand very good logic qubits you can solve very impactful problems in the world and thus create significant value.  IonQ expects to achieve this in 7 years ([https://ionq.com/posts/december-09-2020-scaling-quantum-computer-roadmap](https://ionq.com/posts/december-09-2020-scaling-quantum-computer-roadmap))

AMZN,Best stocks for the fourth industrial revolution,3666,704,1616437919,"The Fourth Industrial Revolution is characterised by the fusion of the digital, biological, and physical worlds, as well as the growing utilisation of new technologies. It is the trend towards automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies and processes which include:

* Cyber-physical systems (CPS) / Cyber security
* Cloud Computing
* Ai
* Advanced Robotics / automation
* Big-data
* 3D printing
* Quantum computing (hypothetically)
* Robotic process automation (RPA)
* Semi-conductors
* Biotechnology / Healthcare
* IoT manufacturing
* Renewable energy
* Manufacturing / Mining

Of course there's discussions which one are part of the industry 4.0 so I might be missing a few.

since I believe that we are still at the start of this revolution, I want to invest in promising companies related to those industries. Some companies already have proven themselves, others are still in the 'startup' fase.

**Hereby a list of the companies from which I think are the best or will be the best in the corresponding sector. What sectors and which must-have companies am I missing?**

**Note:** some sectors are very broad so they might overlap.

&#x200B;

* **Cyber-physical systems (CPS) / Cyber security**
   * **CrowdStrike - $CRWD**
      * Offers a broad spectrum of solutions with the main goal of cyber-security. Some well-known clients where they have solved hacks are Sony Pictures and the DNC (Democratic National Committee). The company is the market leader in the cloud-based endpoint security segment and is also expanding into 5G network security.
   * **Cloudflare - $NET**
      * Offers a wide range of network services to companies around the world. Cloudflare's intelligent global network spans more than 200 cities in more than 100 countries. It provides network security and improved network performance and reliability to an increasing proportion of the total Internet used. More than 15% of the internet is used via Cloudflare
   * **BlackBerry - $BB**
      * They are working on AI powered cybersecurity
      * They also work on QNX. QNX is a real-time embedded OS that controls software systems in (modern, especially EV) cars and forms the basis of solutions such as BlackBerry Radar, an IoT based asset tracking system for the transport sector.
      * Spark Suites: Spark provides visibility and protection for all endpoints, including personal laptops and smartphones used for work. It uses AI, machine learning, and automation to provide better cyberattack prevention.
   * **SUMO LOGIC - $SUMO - DD from** u/FlynnPierce
      * SaaS platform focused on data analytics and they will likely be the first to be able to call themselves a cloud-native solution for continuous intelligence. To be fair, they themselves pioneer this concept of “continuous intelligence” where companies can have real-time insight and communication with their data.
      * On March 10, 2021 they acquired DFLabs to enhance their cyber security offering, and claim that the SOAR system they inherit from the acquisition is 10x more effective in improving security operations productivity.
      * Benefits over competitors: design and ease of use, scalability and oriented quality.

&#x200B;

* **Cloud Computing**
   * I'll include Amazon and Microsoft since they deserve a spot in this list. But as @[ArtakhaPrime](https://www.reddit.com/user/ArtakhaPrime/) mentioned: Amazon and Microsoft ""are already some of the biggest in the world and make all sorts of stuff. It's entirely possible their innovations will be integral to aspects of the 4th Industrial Revolution, but it may also only be a relative drop or glass in the larger bucket that they currently represent.""

   * **SalesForce - $CRM**
      * Big data CRM (big data customer relationship management) refers to the practice of integrating big data into a company's CRM processes with the goals of improving customer service, calculating return on investment on various initiatives and predicting clientele behavior.
      * Salesforce is the leader in the CRM sector. Recently, Salesforce has acquired the big data firm “Tableau” for $15.3 billion and Slack for $27.7 billion, adding muscle in its fight with some major leaders. Moreover, the integration of Salesforce CRM and Big Data will enable businesses in analyzing customer patterns and preferences.
   * **SnowFlake -$SNOW - Need DD**

&#x200B;

* **3D Printing**
   * **Desktop Metal - $DM**
      * Co-founders are MIT alumnus Ric Fulop and 4 other MIT professors.
      * They have a new patent called ""single pass jetting"". It takes most 3D printing machines several times to print one layer, Desktop Metal can do it in one go. This makes them by far the fastest in the entire industry (up to 4x faster) - Speed ​​means lower costs, what DM printers can do in 1 day, takes other printers 3-4x that time.
      * They have secured a global distribution network of more than 80 partners in 60 countries offering their Live Parts software as SaaS. Live Parts is an AI software that allows users to automatically generate printable object designs. The program allows users to enter specifications for an object and then create a computer model that can be printed. As a result, they are assured of huge income in addition to their hardware
      * Today, Desktop Metal announced that it launched Desktop Health, a line specifically devoted to healthcare-adjacent products. The line encompasses a number of different technologies, including binder jetting, bioprinting and various materials.
   * **Nano Dimension - DD is from their website**
      * Nano Dimension’s DragonFly System is a one-stop solution for agile hardware development and innovative circuit design across a wide array of industries.

&#x200B;

* **Quantum Computing**
   * **IonQ - $DMYI**
      * A quick introduction to QC: a normal computer exists of bytes, so 0 OR 1, a QC has qubits, so possibly 0 AND 1 at the same time. In theory this will improve the computational power of computers in a massive way and therefore QC wil be able to solve different classes of problems
      * The qubits that make up QCs are prone to error given the fragile nature of the quantum states. There are 2 quantum states: ion trap (IonQ, Honeywell) and superconducting qubits (IBM, Google). These have about a 0.5% chance of an error during a so-called 2-qubit gate operation ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum\_logic\_gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate)), thus limiting the complexity of the computation you will be able to do.
      * So a lot of research is being done to improve these physical error rates, but an improvement of more than 0.01% seems to be difficult.  This is where error correction becomes important. People have come up with error correction codes that can tolerate error rates and create a much lower error rate by creating what's called a logical qubit. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical\_and\_logical\_qubits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_and_logical_qubits)).
      * It takes a lot of physical qubits to make 1 single logical qubit.  Most researchers believe that with a few hundred to a few thousand very good logic qubits you can solve very impactful problems in the world and thus create significant value.  IonQ expects to achieve this in 7 years ([https://ionq.com/posts/december-09-2020-scaling-quantum-computer-roadmap](https://ionq.com/posts/december-09-2020-scaling-quantum-computer-roadmap))

AMZN,Microsoft ($MSFT) DD - Sitting on a gold mine,1803,530,1616519710,"Hi guys!

Today I'm going to be covering a massive tech-giant called Microsoft. They have a market cap of 1.74T and are the second-largest company in the US. I'm going to do a deep-dive into the fundamentals and catalysts that could make Microsoft a good buy. As always, a TL;DR is at the bottom and if you have any companies you want to see me do a DD on, leave them in the comments.

**Business**

Microsoft is a well-known diversified technology company. Most consumers are familiar with their windows operating system, which has a 75% desktop OS market share as of 2020 ***\[1\]***, their Microsoft Surface Laptop, which they've advertised aggressively, and their Office 365 productivity suite, which is commonly used in schools and businesses alike.

Their operations can be broken up into 3 broad categories: Productivity and Business Processes (32.44% of revenue),  Intelligent Cloud (33.82% of revenue), and Personal Computing (33.74% of revenue). Let's break these segments down!

**Productivity and Business Processes**

This segment includes Microsoft's Office product line, LinkedIn, and Dynamics.

Office saw stellar growth during the pandemic. In Microsoft's 10-K filed in June of 2020, we can see that Office revenue grew by 4.5B or 15%. Office accounts for 64.63% of this segment's revenue. I don't see all that much future growth potential here. Google's productivity suite will cut into margins and makes the moat here very small. While Office Commercial could be alright, Office Consumer will probably get blown out of the water by Google's free product offering.

LinkedIn is another pandemic out-performer. This product grew revenue 1.3B or 20% in 2020 and currently accounts for 14% of this segment's revenue. There's a lot of unrealized potential here and I want to go a little in-depth here because I think this is overlooked by a lot of people.

Think about the amount of data LinkedIn has for a second. You **willingly** enter in: your current place of residence, your age, your current place of work, your past working experience, your prior education, your interests, what skills you have, etc. This is a data *GOLDMINE.* All the information Google spends billions on developing algos to infer about you is offered up to Microsoft by over 740 million members **\[2\]**. If Microsoft identifies this as an opportunity they'd be willing to pursue, it could be huge.

Finally, there's Microsoft Dynamics. I feel so-so about this product. It has fierce competitors who dominate the entire CRM industry (namely Salesforce with 19%+ market share), and I just don't think they have a superior offering here.

**Intelligent Cloud**

This is what many people end up talking about the most when it comes to Microsoft. As someone with a pretty decent amount of cloud knowledge, I can say with confidence it'll be a two-horse game in the future with AWS and Azure dominating. The problem with AWS is actually the fact that they're a subsidiary of Amazon!

If you're a retailer and you're looking to pick a cloud provider, you can't use AWS because you'll be supporting a direct competitor of yours. As a result, many of these companies will end up taking their money to Microsoft. It's also worth noting that the government has shown a preference to use Azure in the past when it comes to military contracts.

**Personal Computing**

This segment includes Windows OS, the Surface Laptop, Xbox, and their Search engines.

I don't expect that much growth here. Windows will continue to grow by 2-4%, their search engine will probably stagnate (I'm kind of shocked people actually use Edge/Bing), Xbox will continue to lose ground to Playstation, and Surface's growth will slow.

**Business TL;DR**

Future growth will be driven by Azure and perhaps LinkedIn.

**Revenues**

Microsoft brought in revenue of 153.28B in FY 2020. This represents a 14.18% gain YoY, a 48.90% 3 year gain, and a 74.02% increase from 5 years ago. These increases are very impressive considering the age and size of Microsoft.

Switching over to Net Income, we see a 2020 total of 51.31B. This is up 15.77% YoY, 271% in the last 3 years, and up 338% since 5 years ago. My takeaway here is similar to the one I made for revenue. The key difference here is that NI has been much more inconsistent.

**Margins**

Microsoft currently has a net margin of 33.47%, the highest it's been in more than 15 years (how far back my data goes). This margin compares well with Apple's 21.73%, Amazon's 5.53%, Netflix's 11.05%, and Google's 22.06%. The only FAANG company that has a higher margin than Microsoft is Facebook with a 33.90% margin. Seeing as Facebook operates as a software company only, I'm not surprised.

**Assets/Liabilities**

||Total Assets|Total Liabilities|Cash on Hand|Long-term debt|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Value ($)|304B|174B|131B|55B|

Microsoft currently has a Debt/Equity ratio of 0.42 and a current ratio of 2.58. In case you're unaware, the current ratio is a way to measure how able a company is to pay back debt. A current ratio of over 1.5 is generally considered good.

It's also worth noting that Microsoft's Cash on Hand can cover its short-term liabilities, which is always a plus.

**Free Cash Flow/Buybacks**

As of 6/30/20 (the last time they filed their 10K), Microsoft generates 45.25B in Free Cash Flow. This represents an 18.22% gain YoY, a 44.16% 3 year gain, and a 90.67% 5 year gain. Because Microsoft pays a below-market dividend, they end up spending that Free Cash Flow on share buybacks. Since FY 2019, Microsoft has spent more on share buybacks than they have on dividends ***\[3\]*** and has netted shareholders billions.

**Price Ratios/Other**

|Ratio|Microsoft|Apple|Google|Amazon|""Good Value"" for Sector|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|PE Ratio (TTM)|34.33x|32.50x|34.53x|73.62x|<30x|
|P/B Ratio|13.34x|30.42x|6.14x|16.58x|<7x|
|P/S Ratio|11.78x|7.28x|8.17x|4.11x|<7x|
|P/FCF Ratio|35.79x|26.53x|34.75x|51.15x|<30x|
|ROE|42.19%|90.59%|19.03%|27.07%|\>25%|
|Leverage|2.5x|4.6x|1.4x|3.4x|Depends|
|3-year revenue growth|48.90%|23.06%|64.66%|116.85%|Depends|

**PE Ratio**

I said a ""good"" number for the sector was under 30x. I usually look for PEs under 15-20x, but you do have to pay for growth. In this section, nobody was under this threshold. Considering we're in a mature bull-market, I can't say I'm surprised. With that being said, Microsoft narrowly beat out Google to have the second-lowest PE at 34.33x.

**P/B Ratio**

I said a good P/B Ratio for this sector was under 7x. Very high, I know, but keep in mind these are good values for the *technology* sector. That being said, only Google came in under my good value while the rest weren't even close. Microsoft had the second-lowest P/B at 13.34x. So far, not so good.

**P/S Ratio**

I thought a good P/S ratio here would be under 7x (same as the P/B cutoff). This time, we saw both Google and Amazon qualify with Apple narrowly missing the cutoff. Microsoft ended up having the highest P/S ratio at 11.78x. Overall, P/S ratios were actually decent.

**P/FCF Ratio**

I identified under 30x to be a good multiple for this sector. Sadly, we're right back to where we were before, with only Apple qualifying and the rest being pretty far off. Microsoft had the second-worst P/FCF ratio at 35.79x.

**ROE/Leverage/Revenue Growth**

Microsoft: If you're going to have poor price ratios, the least you can do is be efficient at generating capital. A 42.19% ROE while maintaining reasonable leverage considering their revenue growth rate is impressive. This is one area where Microsoft actually looks pretty attractive.

Apple: Not a big fan of the numbers here. They strike me as over-levered and a future slow-grower.

Google: They have the lowest ROE of the bunch, but they're also the least levered. Considering the amount of growth they've had, the only way I could get behind this little leverage would be if management expected stagnation over the coming years.

Amazon: Amazon is very solid in this area. They have a reasonable amount of leverage considering expected future growth and are pretty efficient at generating capital.

Overall, Microsoft is good at generating capital and is well-levered considering expected and past growth rates.

**Moderate DCF Valuation**

Assuming a 15% 5-year revenue CAGR, an 8% discount rate, a 4% perpetual growth rate, and a 46% EBITDA Margin, Microsoft has an FV of $212.22 (upside of -10.1%).

**Bull Case**

In my bull case, I'm assuming Microsoft successfully monetizes LinkedIn, and Azure growth is faster than expected. I'm assuming a 17% 5-year revenue CAGR, an 8% discount rate, a 4% perpetual growth rate, and a 47% EBITDA Margin. Using these parameters, I got an FV of $270.80 (14.8% upside).

I think the FV is probably between the current price and this bull case.

**Bear Case**

Don't worry, this won't be a Cathie Wood bear case!

In this scenario, I'm assuming Azure loses market share, and Office growth stagnates. I think fair parameters in this scenario would be a 7% revenue CAGR, an 8% discount rate, a 4% perpetual growth rate, and a 45% EBITDA Margin. In this scenario, I got an FV of $168.89 (-28.4% upside).

I find this bear case highly unlikely. In my opinion, the idea that Azure growth will slow is misguided.

**Risks**

1. **Office loses market share:** I've been talking about this one throughout the DD because I think it's probably a very likely scenario. The average consumer is going to prefer the Google Productivity Suite over Office because it's free and offers products equivalent in quality. If this were to happen, Office Commercial (Office for businesses and schools) would probably remain relatively intact.
2. **Azure gets trounced**: As I said in the previous section, I find this scenario very unlikely. It would require GCP being worth a dang or everyone snuggling up to Amazon. As I said before, a lot of companies won't go with AWS because it would be supporting a competitor and I don't think the people running GCP will be able to get their ducks in a row.
3. **Rotation into Value:** If bond yields were to continue rising rapidly, a flight to safety could ensue that would cause a selloff in tech stocks such as Microsoft.
4. **Regulation:** While I don't see any regulation risk for Microsoft in particular, if any of the FAANG stocks were to get hit with an anti-trust violation, it would send big-cap tech stocks into a tailspin.

**Conclusion/TL;DR**

While Microsoft is a great company with large amounts of growth ahead of it, the current valuation is frothy and there isn't enough of a margin of safety to justify an investment.

**Edit:** Hey guys, thanks for all the support. I thought I'd clarify a couple of things and revise some of my statements. First of all, I was totally wrong about Xbox. Gamepass, their acquisitions of IP, and discord integration will be highly beneficial. I apologize for overlooking that. Secondly, I would like to clarify my statements about Office. I was talking about GS taking market share from Office Consumer NOT Office Commercial. I feel as if many regular people are willing to trade computational power in exchange for not having to pay.

Microsoft brought in revenue of 153.28B in FY 2020. This represents a 14.18% gain YoY, a 48.90% 3 year gain, and a 74.02% increase from 5 years ago. These increases are very impressive considering the age and size of Microsoft.

Switching over to Net Income, we see a 2020 total of 51.31B. This is up 15.77% YoY, 271% in the last 3 years, and up 338% since 5 years ago. My takeaway here is similar to the one I made for revenue. The key difference here is that NI has been much more inconsistent.

**Margins**

Microsoft currently has a net margin of 33.47%, the highest it's been in more than 15 years (how far back my data goes). This margin compares well with Apple's 21.73%, Amazon's 5.53%, Netflix's 11.05%, and Google's 22.06%. The only FAANG company that has a higher margin than Microsoft is Facebook with a 33.90% margin. Seeing as Facebook operates as a software company only, I'm not surprised.

**Assets/Liabilities**

||Total Assets|Total Liabilities|Cash on Hand|Long-term debt|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Value ($)|304B|174B|131B|55B|

Microsoft currently has a Debt/Equity ratio of 0.42 and a current ratio of 2.58. In case you're unaware, the current ratio is a way to measure how able a company is to pay back debt. A current ratio of over 1.5 is generally considered good.

It's also worth noting that Microsoft's Cash on Hand can cover its short-term liabilities, which is always a plus.

**Free Cash Flow/Buybacks**

As of 6/30/20 (the last time they filed their 10K), Microsoft generates 45.25B in Free Cash Flow. This represents an 18.22% gain YoY, a 44.16% 3 year gain, and a 90.67% 5 year gain. Because Microsoft pays a below-market dividend, they end up spending that Free Cash Flow on share buybacks. Since FY 2019, Microsoft has spent more on share buybacks than they have on dividends ***\[3\]*** and has netted shareholders billions.

**Price Ratios/Other**

**PE Ratio**

I said a ""good"" number for the sector was under 30x. I usually look for PEs under 15-20x, but you do have to pay for growth. In this section, nobody was under this threshold. Considering we're in a mature bull-market, I can't say I'm surprised. With that being said, Microsoft narrowly beat out Google to have the second-lowest PE at 34.33x.

**P/B Ratio**

I said a good P/B Ratio for this sector was under 7x. Very high, I know, but keep in mind these are good values for the *technology* sector. That being said, only Google came in under my good value while the rest weren't even close. Microsoft had the second-lowest P/B at 13.34x. So far, not so good.

**P/S Ratio**

I thought a good P/S ratio here would be under 7x (same as the P/B cutoff). This time, we saw both Google and Amazon qualify with Apple narrowly missing the cutoff. Microsoft ended up having the highest P/S ratio at 11.78x. Overall, P/S ratios were actually decent.

**P/FCF Ratio**

I identified under 30x to be a good multiple for this sector. Sadly, we're right back to where we were before, with only Apple qualifying and the rest being pretty far off. Microsoft had the second-worst P/FCF ratio at 35.79x.

**ROE/Leverage/Revenue Growth**

Microsoft: If you're going to have poor price ratios, the least you can do is be efficient at generating capital. A 42.19% ROE while maintaining reasonable leverage considering their revenue growth rate is impressive. This is one area where Microsoft actually looks pretty attractive.

Apple: Not a big fan of the numbers here. They strike me as over-levered and a future slow-grower.

Google: They have the lowest ROE of the bunch, but they're also the least levered. Considering the amount of growth they've had, the only way I could get behind this little leverage would be if management expected stagnation over the coming years.

Amazon: Amazon is very solid in this area. They have a reasonable amount of leverage considering expected future growth and are pretty efficient at generating capital.

Overall, Microsoft is good at generating capital and is well-levered considering expected and past growth rates.

**Moderate DCF Valuation**

Assuming a 15% 5-year revenue CAGR, an 8% discount rate, a 4% perpetual growth rate, and a 46% EBITDA Margin, Microsoft has an FV of $212.22 (upside of -10.1%).

**Bull Case**

In my bull case, I'm assuming Microsoft successfully monetizes LinkedIn, and Azure growth is faster than expected. I'm assuming a 17% 5-year revenue CAGR, an 8% discount rate, a 4% perpetual growth rate, and a 47% EBITDA Margin. Using these parameters, I got an FV of $270.80 (14.8% upside).

I think the FV is probably between the current price and this bull case.

**Bear Case**

Don't worry, this won't be a Cathie Wood bear case!

In this scenario, I'm assuming Azure loses market share, and Office growth stagnates. I think fair parameters in this scenario would be a 7% revenue CAGR, an 8% discount rate, a 4% perpetual growth rate, and a 45% EBITDA Margin. In this scenario, I got an FV of $168.89 (-28.4% upside).

I find this bear case highly unlikely. In my opinion, the idea that Azure growth will slow is misguided.

**Risks**

1. **Office loses market share:** I've been talking about this one throughout the DD because I think it's probably a very likely scenario. The average consumer is going to prefer the Google Productivity Suite over Office because it's free and offers products equivalent in quality. If this were to happen, Office Commercial (Office for businesses and schools) would probably remain relatively intact.
2. **Azure gets trounced**: As I said in the previous section, I find this scenario very unlikely. It would require GCP being worth a dang or everyone snuggling up to Amazon. As I said before, a lot of companies won't go with AWS because it would be supporting a competitor and I don't think the people running GCP will be able to get their ducks in a row.
3. **Rotation into Value:** If bond yields were to continue rising rapidly, a flight to safety could ensue that would cause a selloff in tech stocks such as Microsoft.
4. **Regulation:** While I don't see any regulation risk for Microsoft in particular, if any of the FAANG stocks were to get hit with an anti-trust violation, it would send big-cap tech stocks into a tailspin.

**Conclusion/TL;DR**

While Microsoft is a great company with large amounts of growth ahead of it, the current valuation is frothy and there isn't enough of a margin of safety to justify an investment.

MSFT,Microsoft ($MSFT) DD - Sitting on a gold mine?,176,110,1616520059,"Hi guys!

Today I'm going to be covering a massive tech-giant called Microsoft. They have a market cap of 1.74T and are the second-largest company in the US. I'm going to do a deep-dive into the fundamentals and catalysts that could make Microsoft a good buy. As always, a TL;DR is at the bottom and if you have any companies you want to see me do a DD on, leave them in the comments.

**Business**

Microsoft is a well-known diversified technology company. Most consumers are familiar with their windows operating system, which has a 75% desktop OS market share as of 2020, their Microsoft Surface Laptop, which they've advertised aggressively, and their Office 365 productivity suite, which is commonly used in schools and businesses alike.

Their operations can be broken up into 3 broad categories: Productivity and Business Processes (32.44% of revenue),  Intelligent Cloud (33.82% of revenue), and Personal Computing (33.74% of revenue). Let's break these segments down!

**Productivity and Business Processes**

This segment includes Microsoft's Office product line, LinkedIn, and Dynamics. 

Office saw stellar growth during the pandemic. In Microsoft's 10-K filed in June of 2020, we can see that Office revenue grew by 4.5B or 15%. Office accounts for 64.63% of this segment's revenue. I don't see all that much future growth potential here. Google's productivity suite will cut into margins and makes the moat here very small. While Office Commercial could be alright, Office Consumer will probably get blown out of the water by Google's free product offering.

LinkedIn is another pandemic out-performer. This product grew revenue 1.3B or 20% in 2020 and currently accounts for 14% of this segment's revenue. There's a lot of unrealized potential here and I want to go a little in-depth here because I think this is overlooked by a lot of people. 

Think about the amount of data LinkedIn has for a second. You **willingly** enter in: your current place of residence, your age, your current place of work, your past working experience, your prior education, your interests, what skills you have, etc. This is a data *GOLDMINE.* All the information Google spends billions on developing algos to infer about you is offered up to Microsoft by over 740 million members. If Microsoft identifies this as an opportunity they'd be willing to pursue, it could be huge.

Finally, there's Microsoft Dynamics. I feel so-so about this product. It has fierce competitors who dominate the entire CRM industry (namely Salesforce with 19%+ market share), and I just don't think they have a superior offering here.

**Intelligent Cloud** 

This is what many people end up talking about the most when it comes to Microsoft. As someone with a pretty decent amount of cloud knowledge, I can say with confidence it'll be a two-horse game in the future with AWS and Azure dominating. The problem with AWS is actually the fact that they're a subsidiary of Amazon! 

If you're a retailer and you're looking to pick a cloud provider, you can't use AWS because you'll be supporting a direct competitor of yours. As a result, many of these companies will end up taking their money to Microsoft. It's also worth noting that the government has shown a preference to use Azure in the past when it comes to military contracts.

**Personal Computing**

This segment includes Windows OS, the Surface Laptop, Xbox, and their Search engines. 

I don't expect that much growth here. Windows will continue to grow by 2-4%, their search engine will probably stagnate (I'm kind of shocked people actually use Edge/Bing), Xbox will continue to lose ground to Playstation, and Surface's growth will slow.

**Business TL;DR**

Future growth will be driven by Azure and perhaps LinkedIn.

**Revenues**

Microsoft brought in revenue of 153.28B in FY 2020. This represents a 14.18% gain YoY, a 48.90% 3 year gain, and a 74.02% increase from 5 years ago. These increases are very impressive considering the age and size of Microsoft. 

Switching over to Net Income, we see a 2020 total of 51.31B. This is up 15.77% YoY, 271% in the last 3 years, and up 338% since 5 years ago. My takeaway here is similar to the one I made for revenue. The key difference here is that NI has been much more inconsistent. 

**Margins**

Microsoft currently has a net margin of 33.47%, the highest it's been in more than 15 years (how far back my data goes). This margin compares well with Apple's 21.73%, Amazon's 5.53%, Netflix's 11.05%, and Google's 22.06%. The only FAANG company that has a higher margin than Microsoft is Facebook with a 33.90% margin. Seeing as Facebook operates as a software company only, I'm not surprised.

**Assets/Liabilities**

||Total Assets|Total Liabilities|Cash on Hand|Long-term debt|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Value ($)|304B|174B|131B|55B|

Microsoft currently has a Debt/Equity ratio of 0.42 and a current ratio of 2.58. In case you're unaware, the current ratio is a way to measure how able a company is to pay back debt. A current ratio of over 1.5 is generally considered good.

It's also worth noting that Microsoft's Cash on Hand can cover its short-term liabilities, which is always a plus.

**Free Cash Flow/Buybacks**

As of 6/30/20 (the last time they filed their 10K), Microsoft generates 45.25B in Free Cash Flow. This represents an 18.22% gain YoY, a 44.16% 3 year gain, and a 90.67% 5 year gain. Because Microsoft pays a below-market dividend, they end up spending that Free Cash Flow on share buybacks. Since FY 2019, Microsoft has spent more on share buybacks than they have on dividends and has netted shareholders billions.

But reading the boards / forum you wold think this is something new. Heck, even the over-analyzing on CNBC makes this appear like we are in some sort of uncharted territory. 

I am new to this. I got in at the peak as well (like some of you). I was up 20% in Feb, but now down to maybe 2% up if that ( I don’t want to check).

I am in it for the long. I still panicked, and made some changes, selling at a loss and rebuying to diversify my profile a bit. 

I think what would be helpful is to hear from people who were in this in the past , how they handled it and how they got out of the rut.

I am also convinced the so called analysts on TV don’t know jack. Even Cramer... (as an example , 2 weeks ago he was saying PLTR was a good buy at the dip, now he is saying it’s too expensive... I mean seriously) 

Anyways, good trading day to all",0.93,0.25,0.000286961,0.12514348,25-03-2021 11:49,118.0957489,152.3130035,101.9675903,225.1012726,213.4633331
GOOG,Buy 3 shares GOOG. Am I nuts?,8,60,1617152639,"Is it nuts to put 5% of my portfolio in GOOG?  Or should I just get 1 share and wait for a possible pullback ... That may not come?

I already have 19% across AAPL and MSFT with approx. 11.5% AAPL and 8% MSFT.  

I know you're ""not supposed to sell AAPL "" (Cramer 😆)...  but should I sell some AAPL to put in GOOG?  Or just buy GOOG?

I have enough cash for 4 shares, but I'd rather not overweight GOOG.

My reasoning for GOOG is the obvious I suppose plus it's supposedly part of the re-opening (whatever that really means lol).

Or should I just do some partial shares of GOOG?  Do you see it going down at all?

If I add GOOG though my tech weighting will be up around 65% I think.

I really don't wanna get rid of MSFT or too much AAPL.  I'm cost basis 90 @50 shares AAPL and 20 shares @ 202 on MSFT.

AMZN,Quick Reminder: Having a portfolio consisting of different tech stocks does not mean you have a ‘Diversified Portfolio’,2279,384,1617169909,"To whom it may concern: (I’m aware most of you know how to properly diversify). 

I see some investors on here being invested in multiple tech equities, APPL, TSLA, AMZN, SONO etc. and talking about how well diversified their portfolio is. 

Just a quick reminder than having a diversified portfolio means that you have equities with ‘negative correlation’, and/or no correlation in addition to being diversified into different asset classes (equities, fixed-income, cash)(ex. stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETF’s). 

Or into different market caps, levels of risk, growth/value, sector/industries as well as domestic and foreign investments. 

Any political, economical, or social catalysts that can affect the tech industry will most likely affect all your investors at the same time, in the same way, therefore just a quick reminder that having a portfolio consisting of only techs does not reduce the overall risk in your portfolio, and if anything, increases it, as such, you are not ‘Diversified’.

This doesn’t just apply to techs, it applies to any portfolio that only has positively correlated assets within the same sector/industries.

Edit: This post is about the concept of having a diversified portfolio, not rate of return or investment objectives, capital limitations etc. Pls keep comments and topics relative to diversification.",0.95,0.163194444,0.050087413,0.106640929,31-03-2021 05:51,119.6234818,154.7039948,103.1781158,228.4244537,222.6433258
AAPL,"UBS upgrades AAPL to 'Buy,' raises price target on iPhone stability & auto opportunity",264,87,1617202644,"Investment bank UBS has upgraded AAPL to a ""Buy"" and raised its price target to $142, based on a stable iPhone backdrop and the possibility of Apple entering the car market. 

In a note to investors seen by AppleInsider, lead analyst David Vogt says that a ""more stable long-term iPhone demand backdrop with better [average selling prices]"" and Apple's ""likely entry into the auto market"" are driving the UBS revision on AAPL shares. 

The analyst says that, based on analysis, aggregate iPhone demand in 2021 and 2022 should be relatively stable. He doesn't believe there's a ""supercycle"" materializing, but he did raise his 2021 iPhone shipment forecast to 220 million, up from 215 million. Looking ahead to 2022, Vogt also raised his 2022 iPhone shipment estimate to 215 million, up 10 million. He attributes the bump to the ""stickiness of the iPhone ecosystem.""

""The standard-issue HoloLens, which costs $3,500, enables people to see holograms overlaid over their actual environments and interact using hand and voice gestures.""  
""A group of employees called on Microsoft to cancel the HoloLens contract. “We did not sign up to develop weapons, and we demand a say in how our work is used,” the employees wrote in an open letter regarding the HoloLens contract.""

MSFT,I tried to predict the stock market every day in March. Here's how it went - and what I learned.,5288,460,1617285307,"Every single day this month, I tried to do the one thing that everybody says you shouldn't try to do. I tried predict the exact daily movements of the stock market -- specifically, the daily direction, high, and low of the NASDAQ -- and posted my best guess in the daily discussion forum.

I had to pay incredibly close attention to the stock market every day to do it. Every single morning, I did technical and market analysis to try to keep from publicly embarrassing myself. I learned more about the stock market this month than I have in my entire time trading.

To celebrate one month of predictions, I wanted to take a look back at the month of March and share some of the things I've learned.

Here's the first one:

**I can't predict the stock market.**

*Damn it.* I really thought I'd be able to do it.

You can see my [full scorecard here](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/944799e4-93a3-4aa3-9a1a-68059d06c4a2/page/MkMAC), but it isn't really anything to brag about. Here's how I did:

* **Direction:** 65% correct
* **Daily high:** Median error of 0.26%
* **Daily low:** Median error of 0.36%

I was always more interested in the highs and lows than the direction, but *damn* is 65% ever a bad score. I've looked into it -- if I'd just predicted whatever the premarket said, I would've been right 74% of the time.

Part of the problem was this:

**When J. Powell talks, there's a 66% chance the market will tank.**

When J. Powell talked, my prediction was wrong more often than it was right -- and usually by a lot. On average, my prediction for the daily low was off by 1.37% whenever he spoke.

I wanted to look into that, so I tested out some of the big narratives we heard this month

[Click here to see that research visualized.](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/944799e4-93a3-4aa3-9a1a-68059d06c4a2/page/HORAC)

J. Powell used to be able to pump the market -- but since 2020, I learned, the market has turned red on 66% of the days that he has either made a speech or a public testimony, with the market closing, on average, down 1.24%.

**The NASDAQ is often a better predictor of a stock's price than the company itself.**

I've seen a lot of posts here lately saying: ""Why is everybody talking about indexes? Isn't this supposed to be a stock forum?""

One thing this month affirmed for me is that, if you want to know what AAPL or MSFT are going to do today, you have to look at the market itself first.

AAPL, MSFT, GOOG, and AMZN were all extremely correlated with the NASDAQ this month, to the point that, statistically speaking, it can be said that 81% of the variations in Apple's price this month can be explained by changes in the NASDAQ.

I saw a lot of people in the daily discussion asking: ""Why is AAPL tanking? What new is there?"" But -- unless there actually is company news -- that's often the wrong question to ask. 

**The market isn't always affected by what CNBC says...**

One of the biggest stories we heard this month was about the ""bond yield"". The 10-year bond yield went up today, CNBC would report, and so the NASDAQ was sure to tank.

It never really made sense to a lot of investors -- so I looked into whether that story held up.

I'll let you draw your own conclusions, but here's what I can say for sure:

* There was no statistically significant correlation between the 10-year bond yield and the NASDAQ's price in March
* If there were one, it would be a positive correlation. When the bond yield went up, it was more likely that the NASDAQ would go up with it than down.
* There was more of a correlation on days when the bond yield reached a new 12-month high -- but only if the new yield was heavily reported. If it went unmentioned, the NASDAQ went up.
* The days when the bond yield did significantly go up and the NASDAQ did significantly go down were all days when J. Powell gave a speech

**... but sometimes it is.**

That doesn't mean everything CNBC said was a lie this year.

Another huge story this month was the rotation out of tech into value stocks -- and then, at the end of the month, the rotation back.

This story *totally* holds up. If you plot a tech stock like AAPL's price against JP Morgan's (which I've done for you [here](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/944799e4-93a3-4aa3-9a1a-68059d06c4a2/page/HORAC)), you'll see that, 61% of the time, these stocks went in the exact opposite direction.

People really were rotating out of tech and into value -- and they really are starting to come back.

**I still think the stock market can be predicted**

When I started doing this, I got a lot of hate from people who said that only an idiot would try to predict the market. But after a while, those hate messages stopped -- and, instead, people started sending me hate messages saying that they could predict the market better than I can.

They probably can. I didn't do as well as I'd like this month, but, when I was right, I knew *why* I was right. And when I was wrong, I knew *why* I was wrong -- and had a pretty good idea of how to do better next time.

Everything is *not* priced-in, I've learned this month. Take Biden's speech last night. The market didn't even budge while he was talking. Sure, we were in afterhours, but even Robinhood users were allowed to invest -- and his plan had been laid out weeks in advance. But the Wall Street traders were off work, so the market didn't budge until the morning -- when it absolutely mooned.

If you pay close enough attention, you *can* get ahead of Wall Street. I'm increasingly convinced of that, and I believe that my predictions will get better as time goes on.

**The NASDAQ is often a better predictor of a stock's price than the company itself.**

I've seen a lot of posts here lately saying: ""Why is everybody talking about indexes? Isn't this supposed to be a stock forum?""

One thing this month affirmed for me is that, if you want to know what AAPL or MSFT are going to do today, you have to look at the market itself first.

AAPL, MSFT, GOOG, and AMZN were all extremely correlated with the NASDAQ this month, to the point that, statistically speaking, it can be said that 81% of the variations in Apple's price this month can be explained by changes in the NASDAQ.

I saw a lot of people in the daily discussion asking: ""Why is AAPL tanking? What new is there?"" But -- unless there actually is company news -- that's often the wrong question to ask. 

**The market isn't always affected by what CNBC says...**

One of the biggest stories we heard this month was about the ""bond yield"". The 10-year bond yield went up today, CNBC would report, and so the NASDAQ was sure to tank.

It never really made sense to a lot of investors -- so I looked into whether that story held up.

I'll let you draw your own conclusions, but here's what I can say for sure:

* There was no statistically significant correlation between the 10-year bond yield and the NASDAQ's price in March
* If there were one, it would be a positive correlation. When the bond yield went up, it was more likely that the NASDAQ would go up with it than down.
* There was more of a correlation on days when the bond yield reached a new 12-month high -- but only if the new yield was heavily reported. If it went unmentioned, the NASDAQ went up.
* The days when the bond yield did significantly go up and the NASDAQ did significantly go down were all days when J. Powell gave a speech

**... but sometimes it is.**

That doesn't mean everything CNBC said was a lie this year.

Another huge story this month was the rotation out of tech into value stocks -- and then, at the end of the month, the rotation back.

This story *totally* holds up. If you plot a tech stock like AAPL's price against JP Morgan's (which I've done for you [here](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/944799e4-93a3-4aa3-9a1a-68059d06c4a2/page/HORAC)), you'll see that, 61% of the time, these stocks went in the exact opposite direction.

People really were rotating out of tech and into value -- and they really are starting to come back.

**I still think the stock market can be predicted**

When I started doing this, I got a lot of hate from people who said that only an idiot would try to predict the market. But after a while, those hate messages stopped -- and, instead, people started sending me hate messages saying that they could predict the market better than I can.

They probably can. I didn't do as well as I'd like this month, but, when I was right, I knew *why* I was right. And when I was wrong, I knew *why* I was wrong -- and had a pretty good idea of how to do better next time.

Everything is *not* priced-in, I've learned this month. Take Biden's speech last night. The market didn't even budge while he was talking. Sure, we were in afterhours, but even Robinhood users were allowed to invest -- and his plan had been laid out weeks in advance. But the Wall Street traders were off work, so the market didn't budge until the morning -- when it absolutely mooned.

If you pay close enough attention, you *can* get ahead of Wall Street. I'm increasingly convinced of that, and I believe that my predictions will get better as time goes on.

MSFT,"Microsoft wins U.S. Army contract for augmented reality headsets, worth up to $21.9 billion over 10 years",6046,495,1617584936,"The U.S. Army said Wednesday that Microsoft has won a contract to build more than custom HoloLens augmented reality headsets. The contract for over 120,000 headsets could be worth up to $21.88 billion over 10 years, a Microsoft spokesperson told CNBC.

The deal shows Microsoft can generate meaningful revenue from a futuristic product resulting from years of research, beyond core areas such as operating systems and productivity software.

It follows a $480 million contract Microsoft received to give the Army prototypes of the Integrated Visual Augmented System, or IVAS, in 2018. The new deal will involve providing production versions.

The standard-issue HoloLens, which costs $3,500, enables people to see holograms overlaid over their actual environments and interact using hand and voice gestures. An IVAS prototype that a CNBC reporter tried out in 2019 displayed a map and a compass and had thermal imaging to reveal people in the dark. The system could also show the aim for a weapon.

""The IVAS headset, based on HoloLens and augmented by Microsoft Azure cloud services, delivers a platform that will keep soldiers safer and make them more effective,"" Alex Kipman, a technical fellow at Microsoft and the person who introduced the HoloLens in 2015, wrote in a blog post. ""The program delivers enhanced situational awareness, enabling information sharing and decision-making in a variety of scenarios.""

The headset enables soldiers to fight, rehearse and train in one system, the Army said in a statement. The contract, which was awarded on Friday, has a five-year base period, with a five-year option after that, an Army spokesperson told CNBC an email. The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The deal makes Microsoft a more prominent technology supplier to the U.S. military. In 2019, Microsoft secured a contract to provide cloud services to the Defense Department, beating out Amazon, the leader of the public-cloud market. Amazon has been challenging the contract, which could be worth up to $10 billion, in federal court.

AAPL,"For the youth, just broad strokes what I've learned after 20 years investing.",4645,449,1617772525,"#DON'T PANIC

(This was my response to a young investor here. Thought I might just post it, I like to lurk but whatever. Some edits have been made.)

For what it is worth this is my advise:

SAVING IS HARD. Unless you were born to wealth it is hard. Sometimes even saving $5 is hard, and as you climb up in life there are always new things you will see to spend your money on. 

#1 if you see money laying on the ground PICK THAT UP. IT'S FREE MONEY. People throw money down because they don't know what money is really worth or what money can do. PICK IT UP AND POCKET THAT. NEVER THROW MONEY DOWN, NOT EVEN A PENNY. Damn, I hate seeing money on the ground. Even that penny was some time or labor earned, dont disregard that time and labor. 


::
# I cant believe I have to edit this, but some idiot brought it up: If you find a large some of money laying on the ground take it to your local police station. Check your local laws to determine what the minimum amount would be for your state/jurisdiction most are between $500 and $10,000. If you find it in a bag with drugs... well, you do you. 

::

I was really just talking about pocket change 

Try to use your money earned to make you happy, but put some back. Even if it is only $5 this week, but you wanted to go out and have a good steak. 

If you did not grow up with a family that knows how money works you need to educate yourself.

This is NOT thought [edit: or taught] in school. 

You either need family to teach you or you will have to learn on your own. Go to your library and read finance books, subscribe to some financial magazines, and watch YouTube, or go to broker sites and go through their online education stuff. TDA (not that I'm a fan of them or anything), Fidelity both have some good reading and watching. 

My grandfather was born in the great depression to a pretty poor family, joined the navy, became a cop and spent 1960 (he was 30 when this got intresting to him) till the day he died, investing and trying to learn this shit and tried to teach me what he found out, and I have spent the last 20+ years doing it too. I've gotten pretty good at what I can find and I'm 41, still think I'm not all that good at it, but I could still just say F it and retire today if I wanted to. Make no mistake, if you do not have generational support you have a lot to do, make sure you pass on what you learn. I try to educate my friends and family that will listen, but I feel like a blowhard sometimes. 

Go to seminars, or online live stuff. Learn the financial products and how to use them. Learn how to read company financials and how to interpret it. 

None of this takes a huge amount of time. Spend 5 or 10 hours a week doing this instead of watching tv, reading fantasy, playing games (or working, fuck the man).  

In 1 year you will be ahead of 90% of others. 

Don't believe what financial media is telling you, by the time you hear it from them it's already over and the big boys are looking for bag holders. You have to learn how to do your own due diligence. Never believe anything you can't verify.  Pretty sure CrMer was shouting to buy lemanbrothers in 2008... that worked out well?

Broad market ETFs are seeming more and more like those bundled loan securities pre 2008. Looks like we might see more losers than winner soon, but I could be wrong.... do your research. 

I like managed funds. Vanguard and Fidelity have their reputation for a GOOD reason, and they have their own clearing houses. 

Pick a solid broker, read above. 

#Get a ROTH and max it before anything else, then standard IRA, then brokerage. Try hard as hell to get 6 months or 1 year of savings to cover basic expenses. 

Don't be afraid to gamble a little every now and then, but don't make a r/WSB yolo 90% of your portfolio. Unless that's your risk tolerance... investing really is ALL ON YOU. (You can [and I have] make good money on a meme stock, but pIck an entry and exit; you do NOT need a 1000% gain, a 10% gain is PROFIT, AND PROFIT: IS PROFIT.)

Start with managed ETFs, mutual funds, then maybe some passive ETFs that track indexes. Then, Once you  have your feet wet, and have some cash in savings (don't forget that inflation will take cash out of your pocket, but a market correction could take more [it's a balancing act]) Try some stock picking.

After you have set yourself up  try picking some stocks. Look long term, 10+ years. I like inovationers or solid old companies that just truck along and pay dividends. Healthcare, biotech, chips, multifamily REITs are what I'm in. Go global too. 

Maybe after you are set long term, try short term picks. It really is all about risk and risk tolerance. 

After you have a little bank roll sell some options. Sell cash covered puts for stocks you like or own and want more of for a lesser price. Sell covered calls on stocks you have, and this can lower your cost basis.  

Don't do naked calls, dont short sell. Avoid Infinite risk, but know what your risk is and go for it if you think you might have a win. 
If you bet $500 on a play that could get you 5k I call that an ok gamble, IF you can take a $500 risk. 

If you are not from a family already rich now, its about getting rich in 10, 20, or 30 years. Save now. Learn how this works, have capital for down turns (buy dips and crashes), and ride the waves. This is a lot easier if you are young and have the time to ride it out while you wage slave. 

Look at any chart of any index over 20 or 30 or even 100 years, guess what ..... stocks go up.

Don't try to out think the market. Go with the flow. Follow the waxing and waning. Markets move through rotations just like tides in the sea. Move with it, not against it. 

#DONT PANIC. 

Don't trade with emotion, do your due diligence and analysis, and. stick. to. your. plan.

Learn how to make a budget and include your investments into it.

Buy 1 or 2 realestate properties. Everything you invest after purchase price is considered a loss and can offset your tax burden (even if it adds value).


Learn some hedges. I take a 1% stake against my positions with 1yr puts or calls every year. If I'm down in a year I'll take a 1% value call option. If I'm up I'll take a 1% put a year out. Its like insurance. And believe me, it CAN and WILL save your ass. 

Time in the market vs timing the market ... time in always wins, but having bad timing can set you back a long time. 

Anyway, at the end of the day... just do something. 

Do not disregard other avenues of investment either. Realestate, income property, land, art, farms, cattle (it's a big one where I'm from), antiques, clasic cars (but that might be over after all the boomers are gone [I'm gen X and still remember the smell of them (and that is a real thing kids)]. 

Try not to fall into investment fads.

When I was a kid these collectors thought these stupid bennie baby things and pogs were for life.... if those dumb*sses would have bought $AAPL instead they wouldn't still have tubs of useless, multicolored, cute cotton, whatever animal like things they would have yachts. Those damb card games are another one, yes I do have some Magic gathering cards worth some money, but I didn't buy it as an investment, I was a geek who liked playing the game with my friends.

And buy some $GME. Even 2 shares. That shit is crazy, who knows what will happen.


*I am not a financial advisor, I'm just a dude on the internet sharing what he has learned. Nothing should be taken as any type of financial advise, but everyone should save some money and invest with using their own risk tolerance and the help of a certified financial adviser (not me).*

**last edit: swords for plowshares boys**

PS: I upvoted you all so far, love this late(early) discussion. Going to sleep now. Whether you agree with me or not, I wish you all solid gains. It is not about you or them, or your gains vs his/her loss. I hope you all make gains and that my small insite can lead future generations(or my own or past) to an easy life where we maybe don't have yachts or pent houses, but at the same time.... have to die young of stress and ill health, and can just have the money to be content and happy and be like me,... spending this week digging a new garden, and not be broken old men/women like I see so often.

And if you dont like that, if you say everyone should ""pull up them boot straps"" then I say Fuk you. That didn't work. So I won, and I hope I can teach even one kid to win to

In 2020, Amazon invested heavily on coronavirus-related measures like safety protocols and wage increases for front-line workers. As a result of these costs, Amazon last quarter forecast operating income of $3 billion to $6.5 billion in the current period. Those coronavirus-related costs are expected to slow this year, although on Wednesday, Amazon said it would spent more than $1 billion on pay raises for more than half a million of its U.S. operations workers.

AAPL,Apple Stock Analysis: Is AAPL a good buy?,54,107,1621884208,"Hey there guys, I just started analyzing stocks more and I thought I´ll try to do that and post it here. That´s my first analysis that I post anywhere. If you have any feedback for me that would be great and highly appreciated. If you have questions feel free to ask, I´ll try to answer everything. 

&#x200B;

Today we will look through the basics of Apple´s business and then see if we can come up with a fair value for Apple´s stock using discounted free cashflow. 

This is not financial advice and I personally own shares in Apple. Nevertheless I will try to stay as unbiased and objective as I can.

First let´s review their different revenue streams. Their biggest stream, around **50%** of their sales comes from the **iPhone**. The **Mac** makes up around **11%**, the **iPad** around **9%**, **Services** around **19%** and **Wearables, Home and Accessories** around **11%**. 

For the valuation: 

We take **analyst estimates**, we discount that by our **required return of 8%**. Then we use the **perpetual growth rate of 2,5%** and that gave us a fair value for Apple´s stock of **$90 per share**. But because we have to account for **Apple´s debt** as well, our **fair value of equity** would be **$86 per share**.

Now feel free to include a margin of safety to that. 

Because Apple´s price is higher right now, I don´t think buying more is a good idea. Although you can always dollar-cost-average. That´s where you invest every month the same amount.

Where I see Apple´s stock price in 5 years. We can calculate where the price might be in 5 years with the **Earnings Per Share (EPS TTM)**, the **Estimated Growth Rate** and the **Future P/E Value**. With this method I get a stock price of **$242 per share** which is higher than what it is now. 

What I´ll do. I believe in Apple. I think they will stay for a long time and innovate even more. That´s why, although the price is not where I would want it to be, I will continue to **dollar-cost-average**. That way I don´t mind the volatile market and hold for the longterm. 

Thank you for reading and I hope I´ll see you again.",0.75,0.7,0.347321429,0.523660714,24-05-2021 19:23,124.6825027,162.2494965,120.0387115,243.5278625,202.1466675

AMZN,AMZN possibly entering health care as a provider?,24,26,1622067809,"I’m wondering if this is very much discussed and more importantly, whether an expectation that they’ll be getting into this sector is already being priced into the current valuation.

I don’t think it’s particularly much of a secret, but just hear me out. They tend to start up a small business operation for a while, and just run within their org. If things turn out well at the experimental stage, they invest hard and fast, through acquisition and/or expanding the operation rapidly.

I’m looking at some tidbits where they’re mentioning employee-internal health services, basically clinics with doctors and such.

It seems to me this is a classic R&D effort inside a controlled environment. If they find they have a special sauce that could work in the marketplace, I would imagine there is going to be an announcement at one point where they’ll position a new Amazon product (whatever it’s going to be branded as, but I wouldn’t bat an eyelash if it was simply Amazon Health).

It’s an enormously profitable industry, it’s very hard to make inroads without serious capital and lobbying capacity, and Amazon has both. The incumbents have for the most part a pretty lousy customer experience, and between the software, the retail, and policy influence experience, I’d wager there is some serious potential. Add to this the currently heightened awareness about health care facilities and services.

I believe there is a 2 year time frame before there would be a significant announcement that would essentially put PPOs and HMOs on notice and make them sweat. There are plenty of successful boutique providers, small local hospitals, specialty clinics, a handful of franchises, but they’re all small scale. Acquiring a business that has the right real estate, and then implementing a health services model that allows people to get most ambulatory treatments without the enormous hassle, admin overhead, and time.... seems like a solid proposition in my book.

Wondering if anyone has some more info or related data about this, with specific angle to find an anticipated valuation for 2023 and beyond.",0.79,0,0.06738885,0.033694425,26-05-2021 22:23,124.4372635,163.2579956,121.3784103,244.2173004,206.3766632

AAPL,I think AAPL is at its peak and starts to show bearish signs,242,423,1622753477,"Today  is the first time I feel bearish about AAPL. It's a money making  machine but stock goes higher because of future earning / innovation  potential and not because of how successful the company in the past. The  headwinds include: epic trial, chip shortage leading to reduced iPad  shipment and reduced future revenue, and possibly reduced iPhone 13  shipment due to no breaking changes.

In  addition to all these, already highest market cap in the market and  inflation fear looming the tech sector.

All the other companies (AAPL, AMZN, GOOG) don't have to make a penny from their music streaming services because all of these companies have way more profitable lines of businesses.

TSLA,I experimented with committing to a $25 dollar per week investment in TSLA for at least a year and here are my results.,1239,322,1625599749,"Last year I challenged myself to invest at least $25 automatically in Tesla each week using a recurring transfer. I figured it would be a good way to build up my investment in the company while taking a manageable risk and potentially getting some market gains. Since my brokerage offered partial share investments I figured it would be a fun way to see where my money was in a year.

After 1 year here are my results:

Start Date: July 6, 2020

Initial investment: $30 (.023017 shares at 1,300.38 edit: after 5:1 split ~$260)

July 6 2021 Investment Value: $2,546.70

Total Invested with Auto-Transfer: $1,300

Total Return: $697 (+37.64%)

Extra periodic market buys: ~$550

Average Cost of entire stake: $447.40

Current price of Stock: 657.54 (about 150% gain since initial investment date)

Conclusion: Although it would have been great to be able to increase my investment on each dip, having the recurring transfer helped me take advantage of the partial share feature offered by my brokerage and keep my average cost low. During the same time period SPY gained about 36% edit: however, the only way to have gained 36% would have been to have had the $1300 I invested back last July. Otherwise, with the same auto transfer method the gains would have been 17% in SPY. Still a good return but 19% lower than the higher risk TSLA investment(math below in another edit). Although it would have been nice to be able put $1300 back in July 2020 and see it more than double, because I didn't have cash on hand, I only got about 1/3 of the potential gains of holding the stock the entire time. This gamble netted more than having the money in spy, but I guess that’s the risk premium. I am happy with the results of my little experiment and plan to continue this process and add a few more dollars per week into other companies and ETF's that I feel strongly about.

Let me know your thoughts. I know this isn't groundbreaking stuff, but it's a small look into what you can do if you are literally storing the equivalent of 3 lunch meals a week in an investment account. Obviously one side note, the biggest downside to this way of investing is that my tax lots are all over the place and if I have to sell, I have an ongoing 1 year rolling date for ""long"" tax rates but, I don't plan on selling any time soon, so as time goes on, that will be less of an issue.

Edit: Forgot to add a little more context: I currently have $150 a month going into a Traditional IRA, 9% of my income going into a 457 (~350 per check 2x a month) and a bunch that goes into my public servant pension. In addition to that, I regularly put ~200-300 into various stocks and ETF's that I hold each month. Although this investment represents a small amount of what I invest and save, it was probably the most exciting thing to watch all year.

Edit 2: this was posted as a comment but here it is here too. 

A number of people point out that the price of the s&p has gone up YOY an amount equivalent to what I earned on this investment. Now a couple disclaimers: I don’t believe that this is a viable investment option for someone to do with their whole check. But here is an apples to apples comparison (excluding dividend which wouldn’t only affect it a few bucks since we are dealing with such a small amount.) But, here is the apples to apples comparison. This is using the weekly open price on yahoo finance for a year investing $25 per week. Again not trying to say this a better investment than spy, I don’t think it is but this is apples to apples.

My AAPL is about 5% also by the way. For some reason I worry more about AAPL though compared to MSFT.  Don't know why though.  Maybe their limited products compared to MSFT?

And a quote from Warren Buffett explaining some key parts.

[https://seekingalpha.com/article/4422384-berkshire-hathaway-stock-5-years](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4422384-berkshire-hathaway-stock-5-years)

Basically - how much a stock can return to its shareholders is revealed by the price-to-book ratio. Buffett explains just how this works but take him at his word for it.

In a nutshell, if a company earns $1 at a P/B of 1.00 then it can return $1 to its shareholders.

If the P/B is too high, then that company must enlarge buybacks (less than ideal) or dividends (worst option) to return value to its shareholders.

MSFT was well within normal limits of P/B up until this recent run. This recent run has entirely demolished its P/B.

* Historical P/B \~ 3.0
* Current P/B \~ 15+

What this means is that MSFT cannot possibly return value to its shareholders like it used to. The value now exists solely in the price it is currently at. And MSFT doesn't appear to have a way to dig out of this hole.

Its revenue per employee is declining, not increasing, and its future growth rate is flat, not increasing therefore not justifying the recent valuation.

To be honest, bravo to whoever made money on the recent MSFT run - but based on the resultant damage to its P/B ratio - I can't say that the return was justified fundamentally.

Plenty of other stocks including Buffetts and MSFT before the last 2 years returned great value to their shareholders without blowing-up their P/B.

When the P/B is high there's only one place to go...down - or sideways while bleeding off excess cash in stock buybacks or dividends.",0.31,0.5,0.039012346,0.269506173,04-08-2021 17:55,144.1549835,167.7359924,135.6952667,278.2246094,236.9733276

TSLA,"Elon Musk says Tesla (TSLA) is worth $3,000 a share ‘if they execute really well’",2313,784,1631022626,"Elon Musk told employees that he agrees with Ark Invest that Tesla (TSLA) is worth $3,000 a share “if they execute really well.” The CEO has often commented on Tesla’s stock price, but surprisingly, it was often to say that the price was too high. 

In 2020, when Tesla’s stock was reaching new high, Musk told his millions of followers on Twitters that he believed the stock was “too high”. It sent Tesla’s stock crashing, but now it is even higher than when Musk made the comment.

Tesla is currently trading at $733 a share and the automaker is the most valuable automotive company in the world at over $730 billion.

Wall Street firms are divided on whether or not the company is overvalued, but a few of them believe that Tesla could be worth a lot more. Ark Invest is one of them. Though to be fair, the company is also a large Tesla shareholders through its investment funds.

This week, they released a new note claiming a $3,000 base stock price target by 2025 for Tesla. Cathie Wood said about the price target during an interview with Yahoo Finance: “Our estimate for Tesla’s success has gone up. The main reason for that is their market share. Instead of going down from year-end 2017 to today, it has actually gone up fairly dramatically,” In its valuation models, Ark Invest believes that Tesla is going to deliver between 5 and 10 million vehicles as soon as 2025. That’s a significant ramp considering Tesla likely will deliver less than 1 million vehicles this year. The firm is also betting on Tesla delivering a completely autonomous ride-hailing network, known as Tesla Network, that is going to bring in a lot of money with high margin.

In an email to Tesla employee obtained by Electrek, Elon Musk shared with employees Ark’s new $3,000 price target and that he agrees with Ark: “If we execute really well, I agree with Ark Invest.” A $3,000 share price would put Tesla’s valuation at $3 trillion and make it the most valuable company in the world. 

Electrek’s Take

Since Ark’s new note was an update on their valuation model and price target, it is fair to say that Musk’s email is basically a direct comment on Tesla’s stock price. He believes that “if executed really well”, Tesla should be worth $3 trillion within the next 4 years.

MSFT,Is waiting for a dip the best investment strategy? - I analyzed last 3 decades of stock market returns to determine if it makes sense to time the market! Here are the results!,976,270,1631885090,"We have all heard it! -- “Time in the market beats timing the market”

At the same time, we are all to some extent guilty of trying to time the market. The market always seems to break some new all-time high records, so we wait for the inevitable crash/pullback to invest. It’s high time we put both strategies to test. Basically, what I wanted to analyze was

**Whether waiting for a crash to invest is a better investment strategy than staying invested?**

**Analysis**

For this, let’s take someone who started investing approximately 3 decades back (1993 to be exact). I created multiple investment scenarios as follows to understand the difference in returns if you

a. Invested at the exact right time when markets were lowest that particular year

b. Was extremely unlucky and just invested at the peak every year

c. Did not care about timing the market and invested at a random date every year

d. Just hoarded his cash and waited for a market crash to invest \[1\]  

For analysis simplicity, let’s assume that you were on a conservative side and never picked individual stocks, and always made your investments to S&P500 \[2\]. For investment amount, let consider that you started with investing $10K in 1993 and for every subsequent year increased your investments by 5%. So, you made a total investment of $623K over the last 29 years.  

**Results**

**Investment Returns : S&P 500 (1993-2021)**

|**Scenario**|**Return**|
|:-|:-|
|Invested only during a market crash|391.9%|
|Invested when markets were lowest every year|371.2%|
|Invested every month an equal amount|312.9%|
|Invested at a random date every year|303.2%|
|Invested when markets were highest every year|263.1%|

The analysis did throw up some interesting results. There’s a lot to unpack here and let’s break it down by each segment.

The most important insight is that **it’s virtually impossible to lose money over the long term in the market \[3\]**. Even if you were the unluckiest person and invested exactly at the very top each year, you will still end up having a 263% return on your invested amount.

At the opposite end of the spectrum, if you were somehow the luckiest person and invested only at the lowest point every year, you would have made a cool 100% more than someone who invested only at the top. Given both the hypothetical scenarios are extreme cases, let’s consider some more realistic scenarios.      

If you did not care about timing the market and invested a fixed amount each month/year, you would still make a shade over 300% on your investments.

Out of all the above scenarios, you would have made the most amount of money (a whopping 391% return) if you invested only during major crashes. In this type of investing, you would not invest in the stock market and keeps accumulating your cash position waiting for a crash.

While this seems like a good idea, in theory, it’s extremely difficult to execute properly in real life. The main limitations to investing during a crash strategy are

a. The current returns are calculated by investing at the very bottom of the crashes. It’s very difficult to identify the bottom of the crash while a crash is happening. You can end up investing midway through the crash and given that you are investing a significant chunk of capital you saved up, it can end up wiping out your portfolio.

b. [Identifying a crash itself is very hard](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F06f96f61-9b99-4d4a-b6cd-88eece3ecc1d_624x241.png)

As we can see from the above chart, the years that we consider were great for the market in hindsight still had significant drops within the same year. So even when the market is down 10%, it becomes extremely difficult to know whether it’s going into a deeper crash or whether it’s going to bounce back up.

**Conclusion**

While the analysis did prove that waiting for the crash is theoretically the best strategy returns-wise, practically it’s very difficult to execute it.

For e.g., even if you predicted the 2020 Coronavirus crash correctly, where would be your entry point? The market was down 15% by Mar 6th, another 10% by Mar 13th, and then another 10% by March 20th for a total of 35%. If you did not get in at the absolute bottom, you would have lost a considerable sum of your investment without actually getting any benefits from the previous run-up.     

It is extremely enticing to be the guy who called the crash correctly and even if you are right, only getting in at the absolute bottom would only give you the best returns. Adding to this, in the last 20 years, 70% of the best days in the market happened within 14 days of the worst ones \[4\]. If you miss just any of those days waiting for an entry point, your returns would be substantially lower than someone who just stayed invested.

If you think you are in the select few who have the skills to identify a crash and the temperament to see the crash through to invest at the very bottom, you will make an absolute killing in the market! For the rest of us, continuous investment regardless of the market trends seems to be the better choice.

its a spy return calculator online ([https://dqydj.com/sp-500-periodic-reinvestment-calculator-dividends/](https://dqydj.com/sp-500-periodic-reinvestment-calculator-dividends/)) including dividend reinvestment

Check the return when you invest following my same logic -- the only difference is it's a monthly calculator (so the returns would be slightly different)

10K per year => 833 per month

5% annual increase => 0.407% growth in investment value every month

1993-2021 return is 394% on the total invested value.

TSLA,Just sold half of my holdings in TSLA.,848,297,1633117398,"      After months of weighing options I decided this was the best move for my family.

      I've been in TSLA since 2015 when I decided to invest as a single mother,  and never sold even when times were hard. TSLA ended up being a huge blessing for me and my son over the years!
 
        I made it through work being closed down for 9 months last year and half of this year, and never sold.     
       So, this step took alot for me, on a personal level.

      Because of my job being effected half of this year, my income was no where close to what it would have normally been...       I decided that selling half would give me some peace of mind with the economic climate where it is. I also knew that with my income being as low as it was this year, that this was possibly the last opportunity to avoid selling in a higher tax bracket.

        Of course, I had this mental struggle between selling and it then going higher.  But I've decided to just not let myself think on those terms.
     
 
       I now feel a security in knowing that if it rises, I still have half my holdings and will enjoy watching my position climb again.  And if it goes down, I will have the option to buy the dip.

       I was surprised at how stubborn my pride was when deciding whether to reduce position or not!   This ride has been wild over the years.

      I'm happy to still be on it! But happy I was able to exercise making a tough decision that I knew was the wisest, for me.

> HONG KONG - China Evergrande Group on Tuesday missed its third round of bond payments in three weeks, intensifying market fears over contagion involving other property developers as a wall of debt payment obligations come due in the near-term.
Some bondholders said they did not receive coupon payments totalling US$148 million on Evergrande's April 2022, April 2023 and April 2024 notes due by 0400 GMT on Tuesday, following two other payments it missed in September.

AMZN,Netflix's 'Squid Game' Will Generate About $900 Million,3948,438,1634503877,"> Netflix estimates that its latest megahit, [“Squid Game,”](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-13/netflix-says-squid-game-is-its-biggest-series-launch-ever) will create almost $900 million in value for the company, according to figures seen by Bloomberg, underscoring the windfall that one megahit can generate in the streaming era.  
>  
>Netflix differs from movie studios and TV networks in that it doesn’t generate sales based on specific titles, instead using its catalog and a steady drumbeat of new releases to entice customers every week. But the company does have a wealth of data concerning what its customers watch, which the company uses to determine the value derived from individual programs.  
>  
> “Squid Game” stands out both for its popularity, and its relatively low cost. The South Korean show, about indebted people in a deadly contest for a cash prize, generated $891.1 million in impact value, a metric the company uses to assess the performance from individual shows. The show cost just $21.4 million to produce -- about $2.4 million an episode. Those figures are just for the first season, and stem from a document that details Netflix’s performance metrics for the show.

AAPL,Should I Buy AAPL Shares,241,281,1635018426,"Hello, I am currently 19yo and I have a surplus of scholarship money that I was hoping to invest. I am a big tech guy and I have been following Apple for a while. Their new 5mm architecture for their chips is absolutely insane, first seen with how crazy their M1 chips did last year. Now, with apple announcing the M1 pro and M1 max, both being insanely powerful and battery efficient, I really want to start investing into apple. I believe that they will take over the laptop market in the coming couple of years.

Today, with AAPL being down since their announcement of the chips, is a good idea to invest around $5,000 or $10,000 into AAPL? I am looking to buy as many shares as I can.

EDIT: Wow this post blew up. Anyways, with earning reports coming later this week, anyone know if AAPL \*historically\* tanks or skyrockets after the earning reports are released? Would like some sources and may hold off until purchasing shares after they're released. Also considering my age, I will just dump all of the money I have rather than DCAing. Also, very stupid of me to say that Apple owns TSM. But the reason why I don't think it's smart to invest into TSM is because the chip designs are still done by Apple, meaning that Apple is still in control for how well the chips manufactured by TSM and how they perform with  ARM and MacOS software. Hardware performance is dependent on software integration -- the very reason why investing into Apple is more reliable than TSM (though yes both are viable options).",0.78,0,0.018162831,0.009081416,23-10-2021 19:47,146.080368,166.7774963,138.2854004,300.7943115,303.2266541

I haven’t counted it up, but it’s likely I encountered losses in excess of $150,000 from making mistakes that were easily avoided, rash decisions, and not giving myself enough time to test out strategies. Net net, I’m up $500,000, but I was asked to share some of what worked for me over IM quite a bit after my last post and figured I’d lay it for others who may not want to waste money learning the hard way, as I did. 

These are tactics and strategies that worked for me and my situation - someone trying to increase net worth, not increase income - and they may not be suitable for everyone.

**Understand the Trading Environment**

One mistake I made more than a few times was not understanding or paying attention to the trading environment I was in before picking out a strategy. What do I mean? I need to know where things are in the year, in relation to earnings season, and in relation to sector rotations. I need to pay attention to the macroeconomic indicators and I need to watch the VIX.

**Mind the Gap Between Earnings Seasons**. I can’t stress this enough. When earnings are strong and earnings data is coming in, investors watch those like hawks. Good earnings reports bring confidence to the market which yields a rising market. 

In between earnings seasons, there is less data from companies to review and investors pay closer attention to macroeconomic indicators like inflation, 10-year bond yields, and what the Fed is doing. This makes for a much jumpier market that’s more likely to pull back.  It’s also a time when the large asset managers rebalance their portfolios. They manage billions, so this can cause large movements to stocks and indexes as they shift to be overweight in one asset class (e.g. value stocks, energy) and underweight in other asset classes (e.g. growth stocks, technology).

I try not to get caught by these patterns. I anticipate they are coming and invest accordingly. Simply put, I buy the pullback after the rotations have occurred and before earnings seasons begin as a general rule. Of course, I don’t do this if I expect a terrible earnings season. 

**Take Advantage of Sector Rotations**

The sector rotations are pretty predictable if you track the performance of the different sectors over the year. I do this by plotting sector ETFs on a graph and noting when one begins to gain that was flat while others that were up a lot begin to flatten or pull back. Professional investors tend to sell off sectors that have been hot the last quarter or two and replace them with underperforming sectors that represent a better value or opportunity for upside. If I run the P/E ratios for the sector ETFs, I can get a quick sense of the sectors that have had a hot run up over 30 P/E vs other sectors that are more modestly valued. Just keep in mind that certain sectors, like Tech, will always be valued more richly given their growth. So looking at P/E ratios is not apples to apples - it’s just a way to note if historically that sector is at the high end of its own typical valuation range.

Last year’s worst performing sector tends to be one of the best performing sectors the following year. This is because investors prefer to buy low and sell high. I don’t bet against this trend, it’s been around longer than I have and will continue to be around long after I’m dirt. 

Last year you couldn’t give away a barrel of oil. Last week, oil reached $80 a barrel. 

One of my favorite options strategies is to buy long dated calls at the money for sector ETFs that underperformed the previous year. I buy calls with expirations in 6-9 months, knowing that I will sell at my exit point which for me is a 100% gain. Sometimes this happens 6 weeks into the year; other times it takes 9 months. So long as I don’t overpay for the options, it works. I don’t like to pay more than the average price return of the sector. For example, if the sector ETF averages a 10% annual return and the ETF price is $100, I’m not going to buy a call for more than $10. That way, if the sector only moves 5%, I can still make money provided the price increase moves quickly enough.

**Make The VIX Your Friend**

The VIX is an easy way to gauge fear in the marketplace and is a hedge used widely against market pullbacks. If the VIX goes up, the market is worried. If it goes down, the market is getting bullish. If it stays up, everyone is on edge. It’s hard to make good trades in an environment where everyone is on edge and ready to hit the sell button. So be careful buying during times when the VIX is high. On the flip side, if the market has pulled back and the VIX starts to retreat away from its highs, that makes for a good entry point. 

Another interesting phenomenon is when the VIX is higher than normal, there tends to be a selloff the Friday before a long weekend. This happens because investors don’t want to sit through a long weekend that might hold worse news out of fear they will start their Tuesday with losses piling up. I’ve found this is a nice time to get some discounts at the end of the day Friday, or to run some weekly puts on Thursday afternoon before the dips. 

**Selecting Trades & Investments**

**Have an Allocation Plan**

The first thing I recommend is determining, in advance, the amount of money you want to invest longer term vs the amount you want to invest short term vs the amount of money you might actually need to have available for life emergencies. Anything shorter term is higher risk, higher reward. I break my portfolio in the following buckets:

* 25% long-term market investment using equity ETFs that largely track the SPX or do a breakdown between bonds and the market. I use Vanguard funds and a small cap value fund called CALF. I will not touch this money for 15+ years.
* 25% cash. I like to be ready to buy the dips and have enough to spare. This way if a black swan event happens, I not only have money to invest, I have money to live on should things go bad for a while. This philosophy enabled me to buy options when COVID hit in 2020 without worrying if I could continue paying a mortgage for a year without a job. It’s also very useful if I have to roll covered calls to offset taxes and buy back expensive positions. I took this from Buffet FWIW.
* 30% options, mostly in tax advantaged accounts (IRAs). I aim for a 50% annual return overall with this portfolio, though it fluctuates a lot year to year.
* 10% long term blue chips stocks like Visa, Apple, MSFT, etc. I defend these positions when the stocks get overheated by selling calls on them and/or buying puts out of the money that expire after a typical sector rotation would occur. That can generate some additional income or help lessen the sting if the stock falls. 
* 6% long-term bets in a Roth IRA. These are equities I think all have a chance at a 10X return but that will take 5-10 years. It’s a lot of IPOs, small tech companies, and biotechs. I have to stomach pullbacks in this portfolio of 40-50% on the belief that a few of the 30 in here will more than compensate for it. This is a new strategy for me so I’ll let you know in 10 years if it works.
* 3% leveraged hedges.These are puts on my own positions, stocks, or the market at large. Generally I use VIX calls, buy puts, occasionally buy calls on the SPXS, and run strangles on investments (betting both up and down on the same stock using calls and puts).  
* 1% in other things I can’t mention due to the bots in here but they rhyme with tiptoe.

**Use Technologies to Find Ideas**

Unless you want to spend 8 hours a day reading news or are OK getting all your ideas from meme stocks and friends, you need to use tools to help you locate investment/trade ideas and be willing to pay for them. I value my time and am willing to pay .5% of my portfolio a year if it saves me time, and more if it generates higher returns. 

I’ve tried about a dozen or so services, including stock picking services like Fool and Investorsplace. Ultimately I decided the stock picking sites were not working for me because I did not want to wait 5 years to find out if they were the right recommendations and lost a lot of money learning that lesson on their pump and dumps. So I switched to analytics tools and my Fidelity platform. 

My favorite tools to use are Zack’s VGM score, Levelfields, and Fidelity. The Zack’s VGM measures a stock’s value, growth rate, and momentum. It’s an easy screen I can run off the basic level subscription to get a list of companies to look at. The caveat is that you need to run this screen often because sometimes the companies on the list get stale and have already moved 99% of the way they are going to move. So you need to keep an eye on what’s new to the list to avoid losing money. That part is crucial. 

The list usually represents companies that are well valued and poised to move up over the next 6-9 months. Warning: they can move very slowly so be patient and set your target exit to automatically exit. I use Fidelity to do my own due diligence on the stocks from there, examining their actual growth and earnings rates and ensuring there is no negative news against them which could drive down the price.

A friend recently turned me on to an AI tool called Levelfields. They have a lot of news alerts but only for the types of events that matter and are organized thematically. It helps me find trades on news events with high returns or get in early on the small to mid-cap companies you don’t usually hear about which fall between the cracks in the penny stock discussions and cnbc favorites. They often send alerts on company events before there’s any news out, which is really helpful. The interface shows you how stocks perform when these events happen, so it’s easy to figure out my entry and exit points and statistical likelihood of success.   
I use it a lot for pinpointing entry/exit points from options trades and have bought stock in a few companies I hadn’t ever heard of before that were absolutely crushing it on revenue and earnings. Not sure why, but they never came up in any of my Fidelity stock screens. I suspect it’s because there’s a lag in the data Fidelity is getting from S&P but haven’t confirmed this. They send a lot of high quality alerts and my only wish is that they’d have a better way to rank the stocks in the alerts so I didn’t have to look up the stocks on Fidelity.

I use Fidelity for basic news reading, running stock screens for high growth stocks at decent valuations, looking deeply at the history of earnings results, actually trading options, and for their options scanner which tracks abnormal option activity.  I sell puts when I see abnormal call volume and run strangles if the stock is at a mid-point in its 52-week price range in case it shoots up and then down. I always set an automated exit.

Fidelity also has a cool probability calculator for options I use when selling puts. It tells you the probability of a stock falling below a certain range. I use that number to determine where to sell puts without a lot of risk. I do two standard deviations out and still buy a put with a lower strike price as insurance and sell weekly puts on high vol companies like GME and TSLA. My typical goal is to make 800 a week from these plays which I use to fund new call positions.

**Be Wary of Analyst Opinions**

If you’ve invested actively for a while, you’ve likely noticed a peculiar trend: as a stock is cratering, analysts are increasing their target purchase price on it. This is not for your benefit. Brokerages often make investment recommendations based on the research provided by their analysts, so there is inherent bias in the system. 

I’ve also found that few analysts recommend sell ratings. They are much more likely to issue calls to buy stocks. One study found less than 1% issued sell recommendations. What’s more, the track records of these analysts are usually about the same as coin flipping. CNBC has gotten very into pushing analyst views from big name firms (e.g. “Goldman Sachs says these 3 stocks are ready to explode”), but if you look at the actual analyst behind the headline, they are often inexperienced or wrong more than right. 

I am embarrassed to say I lost a lot of money listening to analyst opinions and believing their price targets were rooted in reality. It’s easy to get caught up in the excitement of an upgrade and if 4 analysts are all touting the stock at the same time it can create a bit of a ponzi effect, which is tradable. But it boils down to needing to do your own research.

**Good Things Come in Pairs**

Just about every stock has a peer or competitor. Most have several. I stopped trying to pick the winner and now place bets on multiple leaders. I’ve owned Visa and Mastercard. I own OLO and TOST. I have a handful of, um, herbal medicine providers. I like ETSY and AMZN. If you bet on a small group of competitors, it’s likely one will pull ahead and your odds of success will increase substantially. 

Similarly, it enables you to monitor the news of competitors which many investors use as a proxy. What do I mean? If Mastercard reports low cross border transactions, it’s highly probable Visa will be experiencing the same thing. So you can use the information from Mastercard to alter your position on Visa.

**Exercise Financial Discipline**

Even when I’ve been successful picking investments, I’ve run into problems with how to handle my successes. We’ve all experienced the thrill of being up huge and wondering how much higher it will go. That’s usually the moment I’ve learned I should be taking some gains. A few rules I try hard to follow but still screw up:

1. Take Profits Often.   
When an option or stock hits 100% return, I look to take some profit. It may not seem possible if you only bought 1 call, but it is. Just roll the call to a higher strike price and ensure the credit to your account equals your original investment plus substantial return. You can let the new call ride in case the stock gets going up. This ensures you cannot lose money. My rationale here is simple: at a 100% gain, I now have more to lose than I have to gain. You will be surprised how much this adds up when you trade often and how often you can be up 150% then down to -50% on the same positions, which makes me want to break things.  
If you find yourself up huge on an equity investment, switch to options. I did this for my BABA position and it saved me. When it hit 300, I was up 200%. I sold all the stock and bought options for the same number of shares. I had about 60K in stock and switched to something like 6K in options. When BABA crashed down to 150 I really didn’t care much. I was only down 4.5K instead of 30K. I had my profit of 40K locked in, so being down 4.5K was no big deal.  

2. Fail Fast.   
If the option price sinks to -50% in value, it’s likely time to call it quits unless you have a solid reason not to (praying is not a strategy). The other half of the value left can easily be eaten up by the time decay in the value of the option as I wait for the turnaround and it gets closer to the expiration date. If there’s negative news driving this, I’m out. I want to fail quickly. That allows me time to take the remaining 50% and generate gains with it on a better investment. I think this is the hardest rule for me to stick to as I tend to be an optimist.  

3. Profit Both Ways.   
If a stock I hold hits an all-time high in price or valuation, I look for a way to profit from the downside by selling covered calls or buying cheap puts. This enables you to stash some cash while riding the volatility wave. I hold Visa and when it hit 235 headed into earnings, I sold 3 calls and bought 10 puts. This offset a paper loss for me of \~20K yesterday alone by 7.5K in gains, which I secured as real profits. Assuming Visa will recover, that 7K adds 9% to this year’s returns for Visa.  

4. Be Patient but Not Greedy.   
I have learned the hard way from selling positions days before they pop that it can take a while before the market catches on to my investment idea, especially if using good tools. Asset managers, wealth managers, and passive investors are usually looking for new investments every 3 months, not daily, so stocks can stay stuck in a channel for some time before the world catches on to its awesomeness. Example, I held Upstart from April to August this year and sold it because it was running flat. A couple weeks later the stock tripled. FML were the only words I could think of at the time. The second thought I had was that I should’ve bought just one call option to replace the stock I sold.  
On the flip side, once a stock does move a lot higher, don’t be greedy. What goes up fast can come down just as fast. I feel a lot worse watching a stock/option go up 200% then come down all the way or more than I do exiting with a 100% gain watching the stock go up more. Don’t chase the perfect trade. It’s a white whale. Just make money.  

5. Everyone Has a Plan Until You Get Punched in the Mouth.   
This is as true in boxing (thanks Mike) as it is investing. That’s why it’s essential to have a plan A and a plan B should plan A not work out as you thought. Waiting through it can work, but it isn’t a very effective strategy for navigating a changing environment.   
So if my thesis is that the stock will do well with rising COVID rates and COVID rates stop rising, I try to have plan B ready. I keep a lot of notes. I track every trade. I review what went wrong with trades quarterly. I learn. I avoid the pity party as much as possible and drink vodka for the rest. I try not to fall in love with any stock. And I know that even if I lose 100K, there’s more money to be made in the coming years and decades if I stick it out.",0.85,1,0.088401226,0.544200613,29-10-2021 09:39,147.1708984,168.6215057,147.9072571,322.6465454,371.3333435

I haven’t counted it up, but it’s likely I encountered losses in excess of $150,000 from making mistakes that were easily avoided, rash decisions, and not giving myself enough time to test out strategies. Net net, I’m up $500,000, but I was asked to share some of what worked for me over IM quite a bit after my last post and figured I’d lay it for others who may not want to waste money learning the hard way, as I did. 

These are tactics and strategies that worked for me and my situation - someone trying to increase net worth, not increase income - and they may not be suitable for everyone.

**Understand the Trading Environment**

One mistake I made more than a few times was not understanding or paying attention to the trading environment I was in before picking out a strategy. What do I mean? I need to know where things are in the year, in relation to earnings season, and in relation to sector rotations. I need to pay attention to the macroeconomic indicators and I need to watch the VIX.

**Mind the Gap Between Earnings Seasons**. I can’t stress this enough. When earnings are strong and earnings data is coming in, investors watch those like hawks. Good earnings reports bring confidence to the market which yields a rising market. 

In between earnings seasons, there is less data from companies to review and investors pay closer attention to macroeconomic indicators like inflation, 10-year bond yields, and what the Fed is doing. This makes for a much jumpier market that’s more likely to pull back.  It’s also a time when the large asset managers rebalance their portfolios. They manage billions, so this can cause large movements to stocks and indexes as they shift to be overweight in one asset class (e.g. value stocks, energy) and underweight in other asset classes (e.g. growth stocks, technology).

I try not to get caught by these patterns. I anticipate they are coming and invest accordingly. Simply put, I buy the pullback after the rotations have occurred and before earnings seasons begin as a general rule. Of course, I don’t do this if I expect a terrible earnings season. 

**Take Advantage of Sector Rotations**

The sector rotations are pretty predictable if you track the performance of the different sectors over the year. I do this by plotting sector ETFs on a graph and noting when one begins to gain that was flat while others that were up a lot begin to flatten or pull back. Professional investors tend to sell off sectors that have been hot the last quarter or two and replace them with underperforming sectors that represent a better value or opportunity for upside. If I run the P/E ratios for the sector ETFs, I can get a quick sense of the sectors that have had a hot run up over 30 P/E vs other sectors that are more modestly valued. Just keep in mind that certain sectors, like Tech, will always be valued more richly given their growth. So looking at P/E ratios is not apples to apples - it’s just a way to note if historically that sector is at the high end of its own typical valuation range.

Last year’s worst performing sector tends to be one of the best performing sectors the following year. This is because investors prefer to buy low and sell high. I don’t bet against this trend, it’s been around longer than I have and will continue to be around long after I’m dirt. 

Last year you couldn’t give away a barrel of oil. Last week, oil reached $80 a barrel. 

One of my favorite options strategies is to buy long dated calls at the money for sector ETFs that underperformed the previous year. I buy calls with expirations in 6-9 months, knowing that I will sell at my exit point which for me is a 100% gain. Sometimes this happens 6 weeks into the year; other times it takes 9 months. So long as I don’t overpay for the options, it works. I don’t like to pay more than the average price return of the sector. For example, if the sector ETF averages a 10% annual return and the ETF price is $100, I’m not going to buy a call for more than $10. That way, if the sector only moves 5%, I can still make money provided the price increase moves quickly enough.

**Make The VIX Your Friend**

The VIX is an easy way to gauge fear in the marketplace and is a hedge used widely against market pullbacks. If the VIX goes up, the market is worried. If it goes down, the market is getting bullish. If it stays up, everyone is on edge. It’s hard to make good trades in an environment where everyone is on edge and ready to hit the sell button. So be careful buying during times when the VIX is high. On the flip side, if the market has pulled back and the VIX starts to retreat away from its highs, that makes for a good entry point. 

Another interesting phenomenon is when the VIX is higher than normal, there tends to be a selloff the Friday before a long weekend. This happens because investors don’t want to sit through a long weekend that might hold worse news out of fear they will start their Tuesday with losses piling up. I’ve found this is a nice time to get some discounts at the end of the day Friday, or to run some weekly puts on Thursday afternoon before the dips. 

**Selecting Trades & Investments**

**Have an Allocation Plan**

The first thing I recommend is determining, in advance, the amount of money you want to invest longer term vs the amount you want to invest short term vs the amount of money you might actually need to have available for life emergencies. Anything shorter term is higher risk, higher reward. I break my portfolio in the following buckets:

* 25% long-term market investment using equity ETFs that largely track the SPX or do a breakdown between bonds and the market. I use Vanguard funds and a small cap value fund called CALF. I will not touch this money for 15+ years.
* 25% cash. I like to be ready to buy the dips and have enough to spare. This way if a black swan event happens, I not only have money to invest, I have money to live on should things go bad for a while. This philosophy enabled me to buy options when COVID hit in 2020 without worrying if I could continue paying a mortgage for a year without a job. It’s also very useful if I have to roll covered calls to offset taxes and buy back expensive positions. I took this from Buffet FWIW.
* 30% options, mostly in tax advantaged accounts (IRAs). I aim for a 50% annual return overall with this portfolio, though it fluctuates a lot year to year.
* 10% long term blue chips stocks like Visa, Apple, MSFT, etc. I defend these positions when the stocks get overheated by selling calls on them and/or buying puts out of the money that expire after a typical sector rotation would occur. That can generate some additional income or help lessen the sting if the stock falls. 
* 6% long-term bets in a Roth IRA. These are equities I think all have a chance at a 10X return but that will take 5-10 years. It’s a lot of IPOs, small tech companies, and biotechs. I have to stomach pullbacks in this portfolio of 40-50% on the belief that a few of the 30 in here will more than compensate for it. This is a new strategy for me so I’ll let you know in 10 years if it works.
* 3% leveraged hedges.These are puts on my own positions, stocks, or the market at large. Generally I use VIX calls, buy puts, occasionally buy calls on the SPXS, and run strangles on investments (betting both up and down on the same stock using calls and puts).  
* 1% in other things I can’t mention due to the bots in here but they rhyme with tiptoe.

**Use Technologies to Find Ideas**

Unless you want to spend 8 hours a day reading news or are OK getting all your ideas from meme stocks and friends, you need to use tools to help you locate investment/trade ideas and be willing to pay for them. I value my time and am willing to pay .5% of my portfolio a year if it saves me time, and more if it generates higher returns. 

I’ve tried about a dozen or so services, including stock picking services like Fool and Investorsplace. Ultimately I decided the stock picking sites were not working for me because I did not want to wait 5 years to find out if they were the right recommendations and lost a lot of money learning that lesson on their pump and dumps. So I switched to analytics tools and my Fidelity platform. 

My favorite tools to use are Zack’s VGM score, Levelfields, and Fidelity. The Zack’s VGM measures a stock’s value, growth rate, and momentum. It’s an easy screen I can run off the basic level subscription to get a list of companies to look at. The caveat is that you need to run this screen often because sometimes the companies on the list get stale and have already moved 99% of the way they are going to move. So you need to keep an eye on what’s new to the list to avoid losing money. That part is crucial. 

The list usually represents companies that are well valued and poised to move up over the next 6-9 months. Warning: they can move very slowly so be patient and set your target exit to automatically exit. I use Fidelity to do my own due diligence on the stocks from there, examining their actual growth and earnings rates and ensuring there is no negative news against them which could drive down the price.

A friend recently turned me on to an AI tool called Levelfields. They have a lot of news alerts but only for the types of events that matter and are organized thematically. It helps me find trades on news events with high returns or get in early on the small to mid-cap companies you don’t usually hear about which fall between the cracks in the penny stock discussions and cnbc favorites. They often send alerts on company events before there’s any news out, which is really helpful. The interface shows you how stocks perform when these events happen, so it’s easy to figure out my entry and exit points and statistical likelihood of success.   
I use it a lot for pinpointing entry/exit points from options trades and have bought stock in a few companies I hadn’t ever heard of before that were absolutely crushing it on revenue and earnings. Not sure why, but they never came up in any of my Fidelity stock screens. I suspect it’s because there’s a lag in the data Fidelity is getting from S&P but haven’t confirmed this. They send a lot of high quality alerts and my only wish is that they’d have a better way to rank the stocks in the alerts so I didn’t have to look up the stocks on Fidelity.

I use Fidelity for basic news reading, running stock screens for high growth stocks at decent valuations, looking deeply at the history of earnings results, actually trading options, and for their options scanner which tracks abnormal option activity.  I sell puts when I see abnormal call volume and run strangles if the stock is at a mid-point in its 52-week price range in case it shoots up and then down. I always set an automated exit.

Fidelity also has a cool probability calculator for options I use when selling puts. It tells you the probability of a stock falling below a certain range. I use that number to determine where to sell puts without a lot of risk. I do two standard deviations out and still buy a put with a lower strike price as insurance and sell weekly puts on high vol companies like GME and TSLA. My typical goal is to make 800 a week from these plays which I use to fund new call positions.

**Be Wary of Analyst Opinions**

If you’ve invested actively for a while, you’ve likely noticed a peculiar trend: as a stock is cratering, analysts are increasing their target purchase price on it. This is not for your benefit. Brokerages often make investment recommendations based on the research provided by their analysts, so there is inherent bias in the system. 

I’ve also found that few analysts recommend sell ratings. They are much more likely to issue calls to buy stocks. One study found less than 1% issued sell recommendations. What’s more, the track records of these analysts are usually about the same as coin flipping. CNBC has gotten very into pushing analyst views from big name firms (e.g. “Goldman Sachs says these 3 stocks are ready to explode”), but if you look at the actual analyst behind the headline, they are often inexperienced or wrong more than right. 

I am embarrassed to say I lost a lot of money listening to analyst opinions and believing their price targets were rooted in reality. It’s easy to get caught up in the excitement of an upgrade and if 4 analysts are all touting the stock at the same time it can create a bit of a ponzi effect, which is tradable. But it boils down to needing to do your own research.

**Good Things Come in Pairs**

Just about every stock has a peer or competitor. Most have several. I stopped trying to pick the winner and now place bets on multiple leaders. I’ve owned Visa and Mastercard. I own OLO and TOST. I have a handful of, um, herbal medicine providers. I like ETSY and AMZN. If you bet on a small group of competitors, it’s likely one will pull ahead and your odds of success will increase substantially. 

Similarly, it enables you to monitor the news of competitors which many investors use as a proxy. What do I mean? If Mastercard reports low cross border transactions, it’s highly probable Visa will be experiencing the same thing. So you can use the information from Mastercard to alter your position on Visa.

**Exercise Financial Discipline**

Even when I’ve been successful picking investments, I’ve run into problems with how to handle my successes. We’ve all experienced the thrill of being up huge and wondering how much higher it will go. That’s usually the moment I’ve learned I should be taking some gains. A few rules I try hard to follow but still screw up:

1. Take Profits Often.   
When an option or stock hits 100% return, I look to take some profit. It may not seem possible if you only bought 1 call, but it is. Just roll the call to a higher strike price and ensure the credit to your account equals your original investment plus substantial return. You can let the new call ride in case the stock gets going up. This ensures you cannot lose money. My rationale here is simple: at a 100% gain, I now have more to lose than I have to gain. You will be surprised how much this adds up when you trade often and how often you can be up 150% then down to -50% on the same positions, which makes me want to break things.  
If you find yourself up huge on an equity investment, switch to options. I did this for my BABA position and it saved me. When it hit 300, I was up 200%. I sold all the stock and bought options for the same number of shares. I had about 60K in stock and switched to something like 6K in options. When BABA crashed down to 150 I really didn’t care much. I was only down 4.5K instead of 30K. I had my profit of 40K locked in, so being down 4.5K was no big deal.  

2. Fail Fast.   
If the option price sinks to -50% in value, it’s likely time to call it quits unless you have a solid reason not to (praying is not a strategy). The other half of the value left can easily be eaten up by the time decay in the value of the option as I wait for the turnaround and it gets closer to the expiration date. If there’s negative news driving this, I’m out. I want to fail quickly. That allows me time to take the remaining 50% and generate gains with it on a better investment. I think this is the hardest rule for me to stick to as I tend to be an optimist.  

3. Profit Both Ways.   
If a stock I hold hits an all-time high in price or valuation, I look for a way to profit from the downside by selling covered calls or buying cheap puts. This enables you to stash some cash while riding the volatility wave. I hold Visa and when it hit 235 headed into earnings, I sold 3 calls and bought 10 puts. This offset a paper loss for me of \~20K yesterday alone by 7.5K in gains, which I secured as real profits. Assuming Visa will recover, that 7K adds 9% to this year’s returns for Visa.  

4. Be Patient but Not Greedy.   
I have learned the hard way from selling positions days before they pop that it can take a while before the market catches on to my investment idea, especially if using good tools. Asset managers, wealth managers, and passive investors are usually looking for new investments every 3 months, not daily, so stocks can stay stuck in a channel for some time before the world catches on to its awesomeness. Example, I held Upstart from April to August this year and sold it because it was running flat. A couple weeks later the stock tripled. FML were the only words I could think of at the time. The second thought I had was that I should’ve bought just one call option to replace the stock I sold.  
On the flip side, once a stock does move a lot higher, don’t be greedy. What goes up fast can come down just as fast. I feel a lot worse watching a stock/option go up 200% then come down all the way or more than I do exiting with a 100% gain watching the stock go up more. Don’t chase the perfect trade. It’s a white whale. Just make money.

CNBC has gotten very into pushing analyst views from big name firms (e.g. “Goldman Sachs says these 3 stocks are ready to explode”), but if you look at the actual analyst behind the headline, they are often inexperienced or wrong more than right. 

I am embarrassed to say I lost a lot of money listening to analyst opinions and believing their price targets were rooted in reality. It’s easy to get caught up in the excitement of an upgrade and if 4 analysts are all touting the stock at the same time it can create a bit of a ponzi effect, which is tradable. But it boils down to needing to do your own research.

**Good Things Come in Pairs**

Just about every stock has a peer or competitor. Most have several. I stopped trying to pick the winner and now place bets on multiple leaders. I’ve owned Visa and Mastercard. I own OLO and TOST. I have a handful of, um, herbal medicine providers. I like ETSY and AMZN. If you bet on a small group of competitors, it’s likely one will pull ahead and your odds of success will increase substantially. 

Similarly, it enables you to monitor the news of competitors which many investors use as a proxy. What do I mean? If Mastercard reports low cross border transactions, it’s highly probable Visa will be experiencing the same thing. So you can use the information from Mastercard to alter your position on Visa.

**Exercise Financial Discipline**

Even when I’ve been successful picking investments, I’ve run into problems with how to handle my successes. We’ve all experienced the thrill of being up huge and wondering how much higher it will go. That’s usually the moment I’ve learned I should be taking some gains. A few rules I try hard to follow but still screw up:

1. Take Profits Often.   
When an option or stock hits 100% return, I look to take some profit. It may not seem possible if you only bought 1 call, but it is. Just roll the call to a higher strike price and ensure the credit to your account equals your original investment plus substantial return. You can let the new call ride in case the stock gets going up. This ensures you cannot lose money. My rationale here is simple: at a 100% gain, I now have more to lose than I have to gain. You will be surprised how much this adds up when you trade often and how often you can be up 150% then down to -50% on the same positions, which makes me want to break things.  
If you find yourself up huge on an equity investment, switch to options. I did this for my BABA position and it saved me. When it hit 300, I was up 200%. I sold all the stock and bought options for the same number of shares. I had about 60K in stock and switched to something like 6K in options. When BABA crashed down to 150 I really didn’t care much. I was only down 4.5K instead of 30K. I had my profit of 40K locked in, so being down 4.5K was no big deal.  

2. Fail Fast.   
If the option price sinks to -50% in value, it’s likely time to call it quits unless you have a solid reason not to (praying is not a strategy). The other half of the value left can easily be eaten up by the time decay in the value of the option as I wait for the turnaround and it gets closer to the expiration date. If there’s negative news driving this, I’m out. I want to fail quickly. That allows me time to take the remaining 50% and generate gains with it on a better investment. I think this is the hardest rule for me to stick to as I tend to be an optimist.  

3. Profit Both Ways.   
If a stock I hold hits an all-time high in price or valuation, I look for a way to profit from the downside by selling covered calls or buying cheap puts. This enables you to stash some cash while riding the volatility wave. I hold Visa and when it hit 235 headed into earnings, I sold 3 calls and bought 10 puts. This offset a paper loss for me of \~20K yesterday alone by 7.5K in gains, which I secured as real profits. Assuming Visa will recover, that 7K adds 9% to this year’s returns for Visa.  

4. Be Patient but Not Greedy.   
I have learned the hard way from selling positions days before they pop that it can take a while before the market catches on to my investment idea, especially if using good tools. Asset managers, wealth managers, and passive investors are usually looking for new investments every 3 months, not daily, so stocks can stay stuck in a channel for some time before the world catches on to its awesomeness. Example, I held Upstart from April to August this year and sold it because it was running flat. A couple weeks later the stock tripled. FML were the only words I could think of at the time. The second thought I had was that I should’ve bought just one call option to replace the stock I sold.  
On the flip side, once a stock does move a lot higher, don’t be greedy. What goes up fast can come down just as fast. I feel a lot worse watching a stock/option go up 200% then come down all the way or more than I do exiting with a 100% gain watching the stock go up more. Don’t chase the perfect trade. It’s a white whale. Just make money.  

5. Everyone Has a Plan Until You Get Punched in the Mouth.   
This is as true in boxing (thanks Mike) as it is investing. That’s why it’s essential to have a plan A and a plan B should plan A not work out as you thought. Waiting through it can work, but it isn’t a very effective strategy for navigating a changing environment.   
So if my thesis is that the stock will do well with rising COVID rates and COVID rates stop rising, I try to have plan B ready. I keep a lot of notes. I track every trade. I review what went wrong with trades quarterly. I learn. I avoid the pity party as much as possible and drink vodka for the rest. I try not to fall in love with any stock. And I know that even if I lose 100K, there’s more money to be made in the coming years and decades if I stick it out.",0.85,1,0.088401226,0.544200613,29-10-2021 09:39,147.1708984,168.6215057,147.9072571,322.6465454,371.3333435

The market cap increased from $864B to the $1.1T in 4 days.  That's a total of $236B increase in less than a week. The four day increase alone is worth more than Ford, GM, Nissan, and Honda total market caps combined ($67B, $79B, $22B, & $54B respectively).  Four days....it increased by the size of some of the largest car producers in the US combined.

AMZN,Still bullish on AMZN and here is why,95,76,1635707508,"It is well known fact that if you invested in AMZN during 2020 runup in June, the stock has traded sideways since then and it has been dead money for over 15 months now. Last two earning have been bad due to high expectation, e-commerce demand has dropped since lockdown and higher labor cost eating into profit. (All well known facts)

But here is why you should look past all that, and adding more AMZN to your portfolio will payoff big time. If you look closely in their earnings report, they are spending like crazy in their logistic business this also includes last mile delivery and EV investment.

This is a company that generates revenue of over $400B a year, as soon as they make their operation more efficient and spending drops. Its going to generate amazing profit. 

On top of this their selfdriving division Zoox is now running Level 3 autonomous in seattle and announcing project kuiper partnership with verizon. And ofc AWS is still growing over 30% which is nuts since they are already a market leader. 

Bottomline is AMZN has lot of things going for at the moment and lot of catalyst can send this stock to moon. Here is my list

* Improving profit margin (more automation, EV and Drone delivery)
* Integrating Zoox and Project Kuiper with Prime

AAPL,Is AAPL a good buy right now?,210,219,1638224128,"Hey there guys, I just started analyzing stocks more and I thought I´ll try to do that and post it here. That´s my second analysis for AAPL, the last one was from May. If you have any feedback for me that would be great and highly appreciated. If you have questions feel free to ask, I´ll try to answer everything.

Today we will look through the basics of Apple´s business and then see if we can come up with a fair value for Apple´s stock using discounted free cashflow.

This is not financial advice and I personally own shares in Apple. Nevertheless I will try to stay as unbiased and objective as I can.

First let´s review their different revenue streams. Their biggest stream, around **50%** of their sales comes from the **iPhone**. The **Mac** makes up around **11%**, the **iPad** around **9%**, **Services** around **19%** and **Wearables, Home and Accessories** around **11%**.

For the valuation:

We take **analyst estimates**, we discount that by our **required return of 8%**. Then we use the **perpetual growth rate of 2,5%** and that gave us a fair value for Apple´s stock of **$99 per share**. But because we have to account for **Apple´s debt** as well, our **fair value of equity** would be **$94 per share**.

Now feel free to include a margin of safety to that.

With Apple´s price being at **$160** **per share** right now, it´s a little too high. That´s why I don´t think buying heavily is a good idea. Although you can always dollar-cost-average. That´s where you invest every month the same amount.

**Where I see Apple´s stock price in 5 years.** We can calculate where the price might be in 5 years with the **Earnings Per Share (EPS TTM)**, the **Estimated Growth Rate** and the **Future P/E Value**. With this method I get a stock price of **$293 per share** which is higher than what it is now. Almost double. That´s why you have to be careful with this analysis. Always do your own due diligence.

**What I´ll do.** I believe in Apple. I think they will stay for a long time and innovate even more. That´s why, although the price is not where I would want it to be, I will continue to **dollar-cost-average**. That way I don´t mind the volatile market and hold for the longterm. Even if they don´t double in 5 years, I´m rather bullish on this company.

Thank you for reading and I hope I´ll see you again.",0.82,0.492857143,0.256107143,0.374482143,29-11-2021 22:15,157.6574402,178.0785065,145.7560577,328.1201782,378.9966736
MSFT,Cathie Wood has everyone fooled with her 5 year plans,950,549,1638555765,"
One of the most interesting rebuttals to bears pointing out the obvious flaws and bad price action in ARK is “buy the dip because Cathie Wood said this is a 5 year plan”. This sounds great in theory and probably calms the bag holders at night, but realistically it’s horrible advice. 

In 2000 dot com bubble, people who were buying every stock with dot com at the end probably thought it was a good idea. In fact, when the bubble popped and many investors kept averaging down, they probably had the same thought. It’ll go back up in 5 years anyways, right? Wrong. From the peak of the tech bubble, it took the NASDAQ nearly 12 years to return back to where it was. Even if you picked the top of the cream, let’s say Microsoft - MSFT did not return to its peak 2000 price again until 2010. So, saying everything is a 5 year plan and you’ll be a millionaire in 2026 is great, until you’re stuck holding a stock or in this case, ETF, for 10 years in the red. 

What makes all of this worse is that Cathie Wood trades daily. One of the reason indexes tend to go up is because the winners tend to occupy larger and larger percentages of the index over time. For example, there could be a company today that’s only a small percentage of the index but if the company continues to perform strongly and the stock goes up, it becomes a larger portion of the index, thus benefiting the index holder. But Cathie doesn’t let that natural process take place. She constantly sells Tesla on up days to dilute her funds with other stocks, that may not be nearly as strong. This destroys the entire purpose of a 5 year plan. 

Buyer beware on ARK and if you’re a bag holder, probably a good idea to sell. Good luck to all.",0.82,0,0.118288982,0.059144491,03-12-2021 18:22,159.2316284,169.489502,142.1713409,314.8445129,338.3233337

I have been investing in Apple since 2019 and have accumulated a good amount of shares and option contracts. I understand “you don’t trade Apple” but I am curious to hear others sentiment towards the stock.


Apple is sitting on a lot of cash, inflation is here, interest hikes are in the distance, AR and EV rumors have been mentioned, price upgrades have been released, Apples super cycle is clearly underway..


Where does Apple seem to be heading from your experience? Are we in for some more short term upside as the holiday quarter continues into earnings late January? Will Apple lose steam and stabilize a bit lower? Or maybe Apple and the other high fliers in a volatile market will soon catch up to the broader market?

AMZN,"Six Amazon workers dead, no hope of more survivors after tornadoes destroy Amazon warehouse",2063,377,1639366058,"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/injuries-reported-after-roof-collapse-amazon-warehouse-illinois-ap-2021-12-11/

Six Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) workers were confirmed dead on Saturday after a series of tornadoes roared through a warehouse near St. Louis, ripping off its roof and causing 11-inch thick concrete walls longer than football fields to collapse on themselves. At least 45 Amazon employees made it out safely from the rubble of the 500,000-square-foot Edwardsville, Illinois, facility, fire chief James Whiteford said. Authorities had given up hope of finding more survivors as they shifted from rescue to recovery efforts that were expected to last days. Tornadoes ripped through six U.S. states Friday night, leaving a trail of death and destruction at homes and businesses stretching more than 200 miles. The Amazon facility was hit about 8:38 p.m. central time, Whiteford said. The force of the winds was so severe the roof was ripped off and the building collapsed on itself.

Witnesses said workers were caught by surprise and forced to take shelter anywhere they could find. ""I had a coworker that was sending me pictures when they were taking shelter in the bathroom, basically anywhere they could hide,"" said Alexander Bird, who works at a warehouse across the street. ""People had to think on their feet quick."" Amazon said all employees were normally notified and directed to move to a designated, marked shelter-in-place location when a site was made aware of a tornado warning in the area. Emergency response training is provided to new employees and reinforced throughout the year, the company said.

It was unclear how many workers were still missing, as Amazon did not have an exact count of people working in the sorting and delivery center at the time the tornadoes hit, Whiteford said. Colleagues and family members desperate for news about loved ones gathered outside the mess of concrete and steel. Amazon truck driver Emily Epperson, 23, said she was anxiously waiting for information on the whereabouts of her workmate Austin McEwan late Saturday afternoon to relay to his girlfriend and parents. ""We're so worried because we believe that, you know, he would have been found by now,"" she told Reuters. 

Earlier, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy posted on Twitter that the company was ""heartbroken over the loss"" of its staff members and would continue to work closely with local authorities on the rescue efforts. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos echoed Jassy in a statement shared on Twitter later on Saturday, in which he pledged the company's support to the community. ""All of Edwardsville should know that the Amazon team is committed to supporting them and will be by their side through this crisis,"" Bezos wrote. The billionaire had been in Texas earlier in the day to greet astronauts, including the daughter of pioneering astronaut Alan Shepard and former NFL star Michael Strahan, as they returned from a space trip aboard his Blue Origin rocket.",0.94,0.033333333,0.059574916,0.046454125,13-12-2021 03:27,172.9076233,169.5675049,146.345108,330.8202209,322.1366577

They go on to say that just because they are down this year and indexes are up, it's actually not that bad because the mega-caps are hiding the true state of the market.

Well, let's look at the data shall we...

Here are the YTD gains of a whole bunch of indexes from all the industries that I could think of, most of which don't have many of the aforementioned mega-caps in it:

As can be seen, every major sector of the market is green for the year.  Even travel and aerospace, two of the hardest hit sectors, are up YTD.  Every single other sector is up at least 20%.  It would take an objectively bad investment plan to pick only losers out of this sea of green.

So can we please stop with the BS that a handful of companies are propping up a dying market.  If you are down this year, you really need to review your investing decisions because you are almost certainly investing in companies with poor fundamentals that have been driven entirely by hype and/or trading options in a way that is pure gambling.

AMZN,A message to all of you who earned less than 30% this year,2707,520,1640978164,"Over the past couple weeks, there have been a number high-horse posts on this sub directed at people who underperformed the S&P 500 index this year. 

I am here to tell you this: You might have done everything right and still fallen short of the S&P. That isn't inherently bad nor is it inherently a sign of failure. Lots of great companies' stocks had a bum year (AMZN, V, WMT, DIS, BA, MRK) and some got clobbered (PYPL, telecos, etc.) 

Despite popular opinion, investing in individual stocks is not about beating the indexes over an arbitrary short-term period of time. It's about owning shares of strong companies regardless of what the market is doing. Stocks like V and DIS could very feasibly beat the market significantly next year, and may be better positioned to do so if they're seen as a good value. 

Meanwhile, many posts and comments on here suggest getting out of every stock immediately (and worse, selling while they're down), and that you're foolish for even trying. This is not helpful advice. This advice is only helpful if you're the kind of person whose portfolio is 100% meme stocks with no earnings and you have no desire to learn anything new or improve your understanding of stocks or companies whatsoever. If this is you, then yes, you should listen to VTI or VT gang. 

But, I suspect this is not most people here. I suspect this is a tired stereotype, and that a large number of people reading this understand the fundamentals of their holdings quite well but still underperformed this year. Big deal. If you're a buy and hold investor, this isn't a problem unless there's really something wrong with the companies. We all know stocks are more volatile than index funds. 

There are lots of other reasons why someone might not be enjoying this 28% ride: Maybe they didn't have much invested at the beginning of the year. Maybe they're actively learning and making adjustments along the way. Maybe their net worth *is* mostly in index funds and they just want to play jazz with their stock portfolio. Maybe they're in VT and bonds, which is arguably more responsible, and had a far lower return than the S&P. 

I have learned an incredible amount about stocks this year thanks to this sub and websites like Investopedia, FinViz, OpenInsider, and others, and it has given me much enjoyment to participate in the markets in this way. Posts and comments that demean underperforming stock pickers essentially discourage learning. 

One last point: There is an ever increasing interest in socially responsible investing, and rightly so in my view. However, the S&P is not very ESG. Everybody ""buying the haystack"" is profitting off the fossil fuel industry, war planes, guns, major polluters, animal testing, alcoholism, lung disease, the list goes on. The best performing sector this year was energy, specifically oil and gas companies, the main culprits of climate change. Of course, many people don't care and flout such concerns. But I bet many people in VTI or VT gang don't fully appreciate this relationship and would choose not to invest this way if they knew of a better option. Stock picking allows you to invest in companies you actually support without enriching the insiders of companies you don't. 

In summary, this is r/stocks. We should be encouraging informative and intellectual discussion about stocks, and not ridiculing fellow redditors like they're a bunch of idiots.",0.91,-0.166666667,0.155527679,-0.005569494,31-12-2021 19:16,174.7081757,166.7169952,144.3250732,327.8180237,352.2600098

“Apple (AAPL) officially has a market capitalization of $3 trillion. The tech giant passed the $182.86 mark Monday, making it the first publicly traded company in history to hit such a market valuation. Shares were bouncing above and below the number during the day.

Apple’s rise to a $3 trillion market cap, which is based on its stock price, comes less than two years after its market cap hit $2 trillion. Microsoft (MSFT) is also potentially on its way to the $3 trillion mark after topping $2 trillion in June.

Apple’s rise to $3 trillion comes on the back of the incredible success of its iPhone line, which has spawned accessories like the Apple Watch and AirPods, not to mention services like AppleCare, the App Store, Apple Music+, and Apple TV+.

Apple’s latest generation of hardware has, however, been struck by the same supply chain issues affecting everything from car manufacturers to home appliance makers. According to Bloomberg, the company previously cut its iPhone production goal by 10 million units in October due to supply constraints.

And Nikkei Asia reports that Apple’s manufacturing partners in China were getting days off when they would normally be working full throttle to ramp up device availability for the holiday season.

Stay ahead of the market
But Apple has also shown off some major innovations in 2021 including the launch of its powerful M1 Pro and M1 Max chips for its MacBook Pro laptops. Those chips allow Apple to ditch Intel’s own processors, giving Apple far more control over design and performance.

And then there are reports about Apple’s future devices including the obvious updates to stalwarts like the iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods, as well as entirely new product categories like augmented reality and virtual reality headsets.

Apple’s rise to $3 trillion hasn’t been without controversy, however. The company has repeatedly been called out for its cooperation with the Chinese government including its censorship policies and its need to store user data there. Apple, however, says it “complies with the laws pertaining to local entities that control customer data and provides data as legally required.”

Like its Big Tech compatriots, Apple is also contending with antitrust issues. In August 2020, “Fortnite” maker Epic filed suit against Apple claiming it violates antitrust laws by requiring developers to use its in-app payment system, which automatically grants Apple a 30% fee for each purchase.

While the company largely came out of suit unscathed, the judge in the case has called on Apple to allow third-party app developers to add external purchasing options to their apps. Apple is appealing the ruling.

The company is also reportedly staring down the prospect of an antitrust battle with the Department of Justice, which is said to be preparing its own case against the iPhone maker. That would likely focus on Apple’s control of the iPhone and its iOS operating system.”",0.94,0.35,0.147121727,0.248560864,03-01-2022 18:58,179.0765686,170.4044952,144.7190857,326.2876892,399.9266663

AMZN,Number of Nasdaq Stocks Down 50% or More Is Almost at a Record,1370,504,1641625835,"A near-record number of tech stocks have plunged by some 50% in an echo of the dot-com crash.

Roughly four in every 10 companies on the Nasdaq Composite Index have seen their market values cut in half from their 52-week highs, while the majority of gauge members are mired in bear markets, according to Jason Goepfert, chief research officer at Sundial Capital Research.

“Whatever the fundamental and macro considerations, there is no doubt that investors have been selling first and trying to figure out the rest later,” Goepfert said in a note.

Another way of thinking about the tech wreck: At no other point since the bursting of the dot-com bubble have so many companies fallen like this while the index itself was so close to a peak.

“Valuations are at historical highs, companies are raising billions based on fairy dust, and the Fed is signaling a tightening cycle,” Goepfert said. “All of these are scaring investors that we’re on the cusp of a repeat of 1999-2000.”

Tech stocks have been under pressure since the start of the year amid a bond-market selloff that’s driven yields on 10-year Treasuries to 1.72%. The carnage worsened after minutes of the Federal Reserve’s last policy meeting — released on Wednesday — pointed to earlier and faster rate hikes, suggesting to some that the central bank became more hawkish quicker than many had expected. Traders were quick to unload tech shares, whose high valuations become harder to justify in a rising-rate environment.

All this could spell trouble for active managers with broad market exposures since so many stocks are off their recent highs.

GOOG,"A Little Analysis on Big Tech (GOOG, MSFT, AAPL, AMZN)",29,15,1642880656,"In this post I'm going to look at Big Tech.  The earnings multiples, the growth, the market cap, and whether we're getting in at good prices now, or if we should wait for further downside.  I'll look at each of the tech companies valued over $1T (Sorry FB and TSLA).

Let's start with **AAPL**:

Apple's stock has held up the best out of the Big Tech names so far.  It's only down about 10% from its ATH earlier in January.  It has shown relative outperformance compared to its peers recently.  How come?

To start with, AAPL posted its best string of 4 quarters since 2012.  They grew quarterly revenues by an average of 35% YoY:

[https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AAPL/apple/revenue](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AAPL/apple/revenue)

The only other 4Q stretch with a comparable average in that time span was Q4-2014 to Q3-2015 where they averaged \~25% revenue growth.  So this has been an incredible 4 quarter run for Apple.  They have seen price growth from both multiple expansion and sales growth in that time frame.  Between 2009 and 2019, this stock traded below a 20 PE.

Why?  Because the market stopped viewing it as a growth stock.  Today that's all changed and it's going for a PE of 29+.  Until it shows signs of slowing, this PE is more than reasonable.  Apple's EPS rose by 66.22% YoY for Q3 in 2021.  A single year of 45%+ EPS growth would compress their current PE ratio below 20.  This company is absolutely worth the high PE right now, unless you have reason to believe their earnings will start disappointing this quarter and beyond.

A PE ratio is a snapshot in time.  Growing your profit at a 65% clip YoY cuts your PE ratio by over a third in one year.  Even at half the earnings growth from last year, it would be undervalued today, IMO.  That would put it at around 22 PE next year at current prices.  Hardly expensive for a company like Apple in a growth spurt.

Now let's check out **GOOG**:

This one is my favorite.  While stocks like Apple have much more volatile earnings growth over the past decade, GOOG is nearly the most reliable grower you could ever find.  And they've also had a ridiculous past 4 quarters, posting average revenue growth of 40% YoY on a quarterly basis for the past 4 quarters.  

[https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GOOG/alphabet/revenue](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GOOG/alphabet/revenue)

Google has only had 2 negative revenue growth quarters YoY since 2006.  This includes the GFC, rising interest rates in 2018, and COVID.  This thing just keeps churning out more money every single quarter.  Their earnings growth is more sporadic, but for good reason.  They are heavily reinvesting into R&D and are dominant in many different verticals.

YouTube is Google.  Maps are Google.  Android is Google.  Play Store is Google.  Gmail is Google.  Chrome is Google.  Cloud.  Their autonomous vehicle project Waymo is widely regarded as the industry leader.  And of course Google Search is the most lucrative advertising engine in the history of the Earth.

Google also trades at a low PE historically.  Today it's about 25.7.  The lowest it's been since 2015 is \~21 in 2019.  This is a company that is heavily prioritizing revenue growth over earnings.  There are many times in history where Google was trading at 30, 40, even 50 PE ratio.  They spent 42% of their net income this year ($30B) on Research & Development.  

If you added that back into their NI, they'd be trading at a PE below 20.  On a company which grows revenue in 96%+ of every quarter since 2006.

Next up, let's look at **MSFT:**

MSFT, similarly to Apple, had a rough Q2-2015 to Q2-2016.  Big negative revenue growth.  Since then though, they've increased YoY quarterly revenue in 95% of every quarter.  The only other negative quarter since was -3.19% (Q2-2017).  Their average quarterly YoY revenue growth since Q2-2016 is about 15%.

This one is trading at a 33.74 PE ratio.  Definitely on the higher end since 2006, but MSFT was a bit lost once Apple released the iPhone.  The market overestimated the importance of mobile to the company.    In the last 4 quarters MSFT has averaged 45% YoY revenue growth.  They also have better gross margins than Apple / Google.

MSFT is probably fine, but their history shows volatility in revenue growth and their multiple is higher than their peers.  I have no doubt the company will continue to crush long term, but I think it's the riskier buy right now, because they are trading much higher than their traditional PE.  A single earnings miss could easily cost them 15%+ in this environment.

Finally we have **AMZN**:

AMZN is the GOAT at revenue growth.  Even Google can't touch the consistency of AMZN.  Since 2006, their YoY quarterly revenue growth has always been positive.  Think about how absurd that is.  60+ quarters of consistent revenue growth.  

[https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMZN/amazon/revenue](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMZN/amazon/revenue)

Even crazier, their lowest YoY quarterly revenue growth in that timespan... 14.6% (Q4-2014).  What an absurd company.  They had some massive growth during the height of the Pandemic.  They've had trouble growing on top of those big gains, but they ARE still growing, even compared to their revenues during the lockdowns of 2020 when everyone was using Amazon for everything.

Q4 earnings will obviously be a big deal here since they get a big boost for the holidays.  It will be difficult to top their $125.55B in revenue from Q4 2020, but the market seems to believe it's possible.  10% growth in revenue YoY would be their slowest quarterly gain since 2006, so the bar is pretty high!

This is a company which has historically traded at huge PE.  Amazon has continued to prioritize growth and there's no reason to doubt them now.  E-commerce has really been put on fast forward through the Pandemic.  Not to mention their AWS platform which prints money.  

They also spend huge on R&D.  $42.7B in 2020.  That's about twice their Net Income.  So if you combine that with their earnings, their PE is slashed by 66% to 19.75.  If you want to talk moats, Amazon's ecommerce platform is insane.  The amount of investment and efficiency needed to provide their service is just unimaginable.  

Walmart is the nearest with their Walmart+ subscription, which they claim has 32M users.  Amazon Prime has over 200M.  Amazon has also made a big step into video games.  They own Twitch, the top streaming platform, and their New World MMORPG has gotten some good traction.  Long story short, Amazon's cemented into our lives and is not going anywhere.  Plenty of potential new countries for global expansion as well.

**Overall environment:**

**Are these stocks trading at historically high multiples?**  That seems to have been the narrative over the past year or two.  Multiple expansion due to the Fed's easy money policies.  Valuations outpacing results.  In terms of Big Tech, I'm not really seeing this.  Especially in AMZN and GOOG, the multiples are at historically low levels.

Multiples are also irrelevant without factoring in growth.  These companies have increased earnings and revenues at a huge clip since COVID.  The world has become increasingly online.  While this effect may subside slightly, there is some permanence to it as well.  We have permanently changed the way we work and our behavior.  

If these companies can continue to grow revenues, which AMZN and GOOG have done in over 95% of quarters dating back to 2006, they will continue to greatly outperform the market in the medium/long term.  The current valuations seem:

* Bad-very bad if growth slows considerably or goes negative
* Fine if growth slows and trends towards historic averages
* Good-great if growth continues at current rates
* Amazing if growth accelerates

So unless you are expecting a major reversal on big tech earnings, and think that the companies will start seeing considerable revenue growth contraction, my opinion is that these stocks are actually pretty cheap at these prices.  My top pick is GOOG which will benefit from reopening, since they will capture growth from travel industry and other reopening plays.  While some stocks may see headwinds from a reopened world, GOOG seems to win either way.  They're also priced very reasonably on a historic basis.",0.88,-0.09375,0.081572322,-0.006088839,22-01-2022 19:44,159.7924652,142.6430054,129.7733002,288.5465088,314.6333313
MSFT,"A Little Analysis on Big Tech (GOOG, MSFT, AAPL, AMZN)",31,15,1642880656,"In this post I'm going to look at Big Tech.  The earnings multiples, the growth, the market cap, and whether we're getting in at good prices now, or if we should wait for further downside.  I'll look at each of the tech companies valued over $1T (Sorry FB and TSLA).

Let's start with **AAPL**:

Apple's stock has held up the best out of the Big Tech names so far.  It's only down about 10% from its ATH earlier in January.  It has shown relative outperformance compared to its peers recently.  How come?

To start with, AAPL posted its best string of 4 quarters since 2012.  They grew quarterly revenues by an average of 35% YoY:

[https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AAPL/apple/revenue](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AAPL/apple/revenue)

The only other 4Q stretch with a comparable average in that time span was Q4-2014 to Q3-2015 where they averaged \~25% revenue growth.  So this has been an incredible 4 quarter run for Apple.  They have seen price growth from both multiple expansion and sales growth in that time frame.  Between 2009 and 2019, this stock traded below a 20 PE.

Why?  Because the market stopped viewing it as a growth stock.  Today that's all changed and it's going for a PE of 29+.  Until it shows signs of slowing, this PE is more than reasonable.  Apple's EPS rose by 66.22% YoY for Q3 in 2021.  A single year of 45%+ EPS growth would compress their current PE ratio below 20.  This company is absolutely worth the high PE right now, unless you have reason to believe their earnings will start disappointing this quarter and beyond.

A PE ratio is a snapshot in time.  Growing your profit at a 65% clip YoY cuts your PE ratio by over a third in one year.  Even at half the earnings growth from last year, it would be undervalued today, IMO.  That would put it at around 22 PE next year at current prices.  Hardly expensive for a company like Apple in a growth spurt.

Now let's check out **GOOG**:

This one is my favorite.  While stocks like Apple have much more volatile earnings growth over the past decade, GOOG is nearly the most reliable grower you could ever find.  And they've also had a ridiculous past 4 quarters, posting average revenue growth of 40% YoY on a quarterly basis for the past 4 quarters.  

[https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GOOG/alphabet/revenue](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GOOG/alphabet/revenue)

Google has only had 2 negative revenue growth quarters YoY since 2006.  This includes the GFC, rising interest rates in 2018, and COVID.  This thing just keeps churning out more money every single quarter.  Their earnings growth is more sporadic, but for good reason.  They are heavily reinvesting into R&D and are dominant in many different verticals.

YouTube is Google.  Maps are Google.  Android is Google.  Play Store is Google.  Gmail is Google.  Chrome is Google.  Cloud.  Their autonomous vehicle project Waymo is widely regarded as the industry leader.  And of course Google Search is the most lucrative advertising engine in the history of the Earth.

Google also trades at a low PE historically.  Today it's about 25.7.  The lowest it's been since 2015 is \~21 in 2019.  This is a company that is heavily prioritizing revenue growth over earnings.  There are many times in history where Google was trading at 30, 40, even 50 PE ratio.  They spent 42% of their net income this year ($30B) on Research & Development.  

If you added that back into their NI, they'd be trading at a PE below 20.  On a company which grows revenue in 96%+ of every quarter since 2006.

Next up, let's look at **MSFT:**

MSFT, similarly to Apple, had a rough Q2-2015 to Q2-2016.  Big negative revenue growth.  Since then though, they've increased YoY quarterly revenue in 95% of every quarter.  The only other negative quarter since was -3.19% (Q2-2017).  Their average quarterly YoY revenue growth since Q2-2016 is about 15%.

This one is trading at a 33.74 PE ratio.  Definitely on the higher end since 2006, but MSFT was a bit lost once Apple released the iPhone.  The market overestimated the importance of mobile to the company.    In the last 4 quarters MSFT has averaged 45% YoY revenue growth.  They also have better gross margins than Apple / Google.

MSFT is probably fine, but their history shows volatility in revenue growth and their multiple is higher than their peers.  I have no doubt the company will continue to crush long term, but I think it's the riskier buy right now, because they are trading much higher than their traditional PE.  A single earnings miss could easily cost them 15%+ in this environment.

Finally we have **AMZN**:

AMZN is the GOAT at revenue growth.  Even Google can't touch the consistency of AMZN.  Since 2006, their YoY quarterly revenue growth has always been positive.  Think about how absurd that is.  60+ quarters of consistent revenue growth.

AAPL,Bad Apple: Why AAPL is Heavily Overvalued,47,141,1643177538,"Let me first start by saying AAPL is a tremendous company with an incredibly strong present and future - contrary to the title. They make great products and are constantly looking to innovate. If you are an investor I believe you will likely see strong returns over a longer time horizon.

Right now however, AAPL is overvalued in my opinion.

Let's observe the last 4 years of revenue:

* 2018 = $266B
* 2019 = $260B
* 2020 = $275B
* **2021 = $366B**

One of these things is not like the other. As you can see, prior to 2021 we saw relatively stable growth, and then BOOM 33%. On the surface this looks great! But let's get into why this has me worried.

I'm a health insurance actuary and in our world we recognize a phenomenon call a benefit **RUSH-CRUSH-HUSH.** This occurs when there are **plan design changes**.

**RUSH**

When a new benefit is added, or there is a significant benefit increase beyond what we would typically observe. People **RUSH** to use the new benefits as they get new glasses, get their cavities filled, and get that procedure they've been holding off on in anticipation of the benefit increase.

**CRUSH**

The next year there is nothing to spend money on. Everyone already got their new glasses, teeth are filled, and that procedure they got fixed whatever health issue they had. The inflated spending experience a **CRUSH.**

**HUSH**

2-years after the plan change this volatility will **HUSH.** We will observe that claiming returns to a level that we would typically expect, but since the prior year was a CRUSH, the year-over-year increase appears more severe than expected. This would catch a layman off guard, but a well informed actuary would understand that benefits are simply returning back to a reasonable level.

In the case of AAPL. The plan design change is the pandemic. People weren't spending money on restaurants, bars, travel, concerts, sports, etc. so they had more dollars to allocate to updating their gadgets (**RUSH**). In 2022, people will have already updated their gadgets so there is no need to go out and purchase more. Add to this that the world is expected to reopen, so more dollars will be allocated to other things mentioned above (**CRUSH**). In 2023, I would expect spending to return to a more routine level, some people will update their gadgets while others will hold off another year (HUSH).

Essentially what I'm expecting is that AAPL will have a down year, worse than expected (because of **CRUSH**). This will cause people to over-sell which is where the buying opportunity comes in because in the **HUSH** phase, we know that spending will return to normal. It will appear to be strong growth but in reality it is simply just reverting to the mean.

I read the annual report to look at the components of AAPL's revenue. I would expect that wearables, home, accessories and services continue to grow at a strong pace since those are newer products that are growing organically compared to the iPhone, iPad, and Mac. However, iPhone, iPad and Mac saw a combined 36% YoY increase and they account for 71% of revenue. There is a chance that the market prices all this in but the point of this piece of writing is to inform you that these changes are typically more exaggerated than intuition expects. With a PE of 28.5 the market expects growth, and if AAPL instead sees a reduction in revenue the market will overreact, this is when the buying opportunity arises and you ride the HUSH to glory!

You also have to hope that the expected competition coming to the company's current sectors won't cause existing growth to slow. And that's not going to happen. Every car maker on Earth is coming for the EV market, because manufacturing most kinds of ICE cars is going to be banned in the future, and they want to remain in business, and will not find it hard to do so.

Bottom line: if Tesla doesn't start to access new business lines (robotics is a good example) it will start to get its ass kicked in EV, and it will collapse and be remembered as a fad.

MSFT,U.S. lawmakers traded an estimated $355 million of stock last year. These were the biggest buyers and sellers,3498,269,1643702402,"Congress resembled a Wall Street trading desk last year, with lawmakers making an estimated total of $355 million worth of stock trades, buying and selling shares of companies based in the U.S. and around the world. At least 113 lawmakers have disclosed stock transactions that were made in 2021 by themselves or family members, according to a Capitol Trades analysis of disclosures and MarketWatch reporting. U.S. lawmakers bought an estimated $180 million worth of stock last year and sold $175 million.

The trading action taking place in both the House and the Senate comes as some lawmakers push for a ban on congressional buying and selling of individual stocks. Stock trading is a bipartisan activity in Washington, widely conducted by both Democrats and Republicans, the disclosures show. Congress as a whole tended to be slightly bullish last year with more buys than sells as the S&P 500 SPX soared and returned 28.4%. Republicans traded a larger dollar amount overall — an estimated $201 million vs. Democrats’ $154 million. 

So who were the biggest traders? The table below, based on a Capitol Trades analysis, shows the 41 members of Congress who made stock buys or sells in 2021 with an estimated value of at least $500,000 — or had family members who made such trades.

At the top of the list of the biggest traders on Capitol Hill by dollar volume is Rep. Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican, who disclosed an estimated $31 million in stock buys and $35 million in stock sales. He’s followed by Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California with $34 million in estimated purchases and $19 million in sales, GOP Rep. Mark Green of Tennessee with $26 million in estimated buys and $26 million in sells, and Democratic Rep. Suzan DelBene of Washington state with $15 million in estimated buys and $31 million in sells.

Congress’s more than 500 members are required to file disclosures within 45 days for any transactions involving stocks and other securities due to 2012’s STOCK Act, though many lawmakers have been late with their filings. The decade-old law, which aims to help prevent politicians from profiting from nonpublic information, is viewed as insufficient by some watchdog groups, especially given how a divided Washington united to weaken the law in 2013 by removing provisions such as one that required putting the disclosures in a searchable database. Independent analysis firms have ended up offering such databases, with 2iQ Research, for example, launching Capitol Trades last year. For the table above, Capitol Trades estimated the value of buys and sells using the midpoint of the declared range for the transaction. Lawmakers aren’t required to disclose a transaction’s exact value, but rather give ranges such as $1,001 to $15,000, or $15,001 to $50,000. McCaul’s biggest disclosed trades in 2021 include sales by a child and his spouse of shares in Cullen/Frost Bankers CFR, a bank headquartered in McCaul’s state, as well as sales by his spouse of shares of China’s Tencent Holdings TCEHY, according to filings aggregated by Capitol Trades. The Texas congressman’s office didn’t respond to a request for comment. His father-in-law is the founder of media giant Clear Channel, now known as iHeartMedia IHRT, and McCaul has ranked as one of the wealthiest U.S. lawmakers.

Khanna’s biggest trades included purchases by his spouse of shares in Walgreens Boots Alliance WBA and Microsoft MSFT, along with purchases by a child of shares in Apple AAPL, communications company RingCentral RNG and Facebook parent Meta Platforms FB. The California congressman’s spokeswoman said he “does not own any individual stocks and complies fully with the Ban Conflicted Trading Act, which would prohibit lawmakers from buying or selling individual stocks.” That’s a reference to legislation that has attracted 35 co-sponsors in the House and three in the Senate. “These are his wife’s assets prior to marriage and managed by an outside financial advisor. No trading is done through joint accounts,” Khanna’s spokeswoman also said.

1) I'll start with the risks to my valuation model: 

In my opinion, the biggest risk to Tesla is failing to execute on the growth plan. The biggest hindrance I can see for Tesla's valuation will be failing to achieve their 50% YoY growth targets.

If there's an actual economic recession where consumers have to drastically cut back spending, then Tesla would definitely suffer. But this risk is obvious, and probably applies to 99% of growth stocks. Side note: Tesla currently makes such good margin on their EVs, that they have the flexibility of dropping prices to meet demand; however, this would greatly cut into earnings and reinvesting into growth. 

And of course there's the silly, but still very valid, risk to the valuation of companies that the market takes an irrational dive of 20%+, and investors lose confidence in stocks for the foreseeable future. However, Tesla's growth target might still be attainable in this economic environment.

I do \*NOT\* see new EVs from other companies entering the market as a risk to Tesla. There are 80M auto sales globally every year. My model calculates that Tesla obtains 12.1M of the sales (in 2027). This leaves plenty of room for legacy automakers and new EV manufacturers to sell millions of their own EVs.

Quick Note: This model is based \*only\* on EV sales. This does not include solar and energy storage, AI, robotics, or FSD. I see 2027 as the peak year of profitability for Tesla EV sales (we'll see why in my model in section 2ai)

Another Note: My model below has a base case (based on 50% YoY growth as Tesla aims for), a bear case (based on 40% YoY growth), and a bull case (based on 60% YoY growth) i.e. in the event that Tesla fails to execute on 50% YoY growth, achieving only 40%, then the bear case shows how the numbers could be affected

&#x200B;

2) I'd like to start with a simple equation, and expand on the details of the equation. This is for year 2027:

$12,000 gaap earnings per EV \* 12,100,000 EVs delivered \* 50 P/E = $7.2T market cap or approximately $7000/share

Sections 2a, 2b and 2c will be the reasoning behind $12k gaap earnings per ev, 12.1M EVs delivered, and 50 P/E respectively

2a) This gaap earnings per EV metric will be the most difficult to explain. I'll start with my model and an explanation

2ai) Here's my model: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12\_Qp2gXP1HV3EC5UOWBytx6Kn5dfNftqkTo0EwP0Ua8/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12_Qp2gXP1HV3EC5UOWBytx6Kn5dfNftqkTo0EwP0Ua8/edit?usp=sharing)

Note: non-gaap earnings per EV through 2021 by quarter: $5628, $8060, $8622, $9208

Explanation of model: Warning, this is incredibly detailed. I'm going to try to keep the explanation as simple as possible, and I'm more than happy to answer any questions. 

Note: I wrote this DD before Q4 earnings came out, and I decided to leave that data point so you can actually see that my prediction was $2.48 non-GAAP earnings (not bad, huh? actual was $2.54)

The black numbers are known numbers (from 2020 Q3 to 2021 Q3). The red numbers are unknown, but projected numbers. From known numbers in the ER reports I was able to calculate ASP (average selling price, i.e. total auto revenue/evs delivered), COG per EV (cost of goods per EV, i.e. ASP\*(1- gross margin)), earnings per EV ((non-GAAP EPS\*outstanding shares)/EV delivered), and I was also able to calculate a sort of ""operational/manufacturing cost per EV"" by this equation:

ASP - COG per EV - earnings per EV = ""operational"" cost per EV

Here's a beautiful illustration of this equation:

[https://imgur.com/a/9vJcx0u](https://imgur.com/a/9vJcx0u)

So now that we have ASP, COG per EV, earnings per EV, an ""operational"" cost per EV and EVs delievered.. how do I project to get the red numbers? I extrapolated using exponential decay. Based on the rates that ASP, COG per EV and ""operational"" cost per EV were already falling, I took that rate and extrapolated out using an exponential decay model. I also assumed 50% YoY growth in EVs delievred (or 10.66% QoQ compounding). 

The math for exponential decay was pretty annoying. For anyone interseted, here's the recursive equation: P1 = (P0 - b)\*(1 - r) + b where P1 is one iteration past P0, b is the asymptote and r is the rate of decay. Solving for r gives r = 1-(P1-b)/(P0-b), and so I calculated the average r from the past 4 or 5 iterations to ""use"" the existing rate of decay. Interesting fact, I had to assume some 'asymptotes' for ASP, COG per EV and operational cost per EV, but if you look at my bear, base and bull cases where I've modified them, you'll see a very little difference in the outlook. The main difference between the base, bull and bear cases is simply growth of sales.

So now that I've extrapolated ASP, COG per EV, ""operational"" cost per EV and EVs delivered.. I can now calculate the project non-GAAP earnings per EV via the equation I used above: 

earnings per EV = ASP - COG per EV - ""operational"" cost per EV

this one: [https://imgur.com/a/9vJcx0u](https://imgur.com/a/9vJcx0u)

After finding earnings per EV, divide by the projected EVs delivered, and then by outstanding shares and you have the non-GAAP EPS estimates.

Now for some interesting (but not very pretty) graphs. Again, take 2029 and 2030 with a grain of salt. The S-curve will flatten

&#x200B;

This is my favorite graph. Through no design of my own, but only from exponential decay extrapolations of other metrics, the non-GAAP earnings per EV graph tops out in 2027 as the year we'll see peak profitability per EV.

&#x200B;

ok, so why do we see dropping ASP, COG and operational costs?

2aii) Dropping battery costs can be summed up with Wright's Law (Cathie Wood was one of the early TSLA investors that spoke of Wright's Law). Battery costs were as high as $1000/kWh\*\* when Tesla first started building the original Roadster. It has since dropped to $100/kWh, and is expected to drop to $50 or less per kWh.

\*\*reference to $1000/kWh: J.B. Straubel, former CTO of Tesla, interview: [https://youtu.be/aWR5-mo8f1g?t=1520](https://youtu.be/aWR5-mo8f1g?t=1520)

Here is an excellent reference to declining battery costs as presented by Tony Seba. This presentation was centered around upcoming innovative and disruptive technologies: [https://youtu.be/Kj96nxtHdTU?t=405](https://youtu.be/Kj96nxtHdTU?t=405)

&#x200B;

2aiii) ""Tesla isn't profitable!"" we heard for years. This is because they were burning cash for R&D. They've made their manufacturing more efficient with innovations like the structural battery pack and gigacasting, and with 2 new factories we'll see even more benefits from Economies of Scale\*\*\*. Also, as Tesla opens Austin to serve the east coast US, and Berlin to serve Europe we'll see decreased shipping costs. This will cause the ""operational/manufacturing"" cost per EV to drop.

\*\*\*[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economiesofscale.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/economiesofscale.asp)

&#x200B;

2aiv) regulatory credits were 13% of earnings in 2021 Q3, and 11% of earnings in 2021 Q4. But I'm not sure I need to make a bull case for collecting free money.

&#x200B;

2b) Will Tesla deliver 12M EVs in 2027? This is a fundamental risk for my model, as stated above. If Tesla maintains their 50% YoY sales growth, then they will sell 12M in 2027. We'll see. However, one thing for certain will not change Tesla sales:

&#x200B;

2bi) Competition. Tesla has \*always\* had competition. They had competition in 2013 to their Model S, and they have competition today. It's the ICE car, and Tesla is still managing to sell every EV they make. A couple points to make here:

I wont get into this point too much. It took Tesla 5 years from their first mass produced EV until they managed positive Free Cash Flow (2013 Model S until 2018). It's not exactly a one-to-one comparison for other companies, but Ford, GM, Rivian, Lucid and others will need at least a couple years to achieve positive free cash flow on the EV segment of their business. But let's say all of them succeed in making a nice commercially viable, and profitable EV..

My next point is that the EV market is expanding \*rapidly\*. New EV models will not likely take sales from Tesla. They will take sales from the Toyota Corolla, RAV4, Camry, Honda Civic, Accord, Hyundai cars, Volkwagen cars, etc. as we've already witnessed. There's no reason to believe that any new EVs entering the market will take meaningful sales from other EVs instead of gas cars.

&#x200B;

2c) The P/E ratio will always be a guess. Tesla will be a company with a presence in EV sales, solar and energy storage, large commercial power storage, and potentially FSD software subscriptions and AI driven bots. I believe (assuming a bull market) that there will still be enough frenzy surrounding Tesla to see a 100 P/E in 2027. The conservative side of me calculates these numbers with 50. By the time the S-Curve flattens, the P/E could be 30.. or maybe 60 like Amazon? It's hard to say where Tesla will be in 2030, but they've always innovated and come up with new ideas.

&#x200B;

There is one thing I confident about though; Tesla should \*never\* be trading at Toyota, Ford, or GM's P/E ratios. The ICE car is a dead technology, not dropping in price like the EV, and is proving to be far inferior to EVs in every way. Plus legacy automakers are not growing (some have \*lost\* sales for the last 2 years). It took Tesla investing billions over a decade to bring down battery costs, and make the EV commercially viable. Something legacay automakers have never done.

&#x200B;

Anyway, I hope you guys liked this DD. I'll try to have discussion with you guys in the comments if you'd like. If you have a bearish counterpoint, then I'm all about discussing it; however, it will help me (and both of us) if you point out which part of this equation it affects:

$12,000 gaap earnings per EV \* 12,100,000 EVs delivered \* 50 P/E = $7260/share

so that we can establish the point of disagreement.

Feb 2 (Reuters) - Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc (FB.O) shares plunged 20% late on Wednesday as the social media company missed on Wall Street earnings estimates and posted a weaker-than-expected forecast.

Meta said it faced hits from Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) privacy changes to its operating system, which have made it harder for brands to target and measure their ads on Facebook and Instagram, and from macroeconomic issues like supply-chain disruptions. read more

The after-hours slump in Meta shares vaporized $200 billion worth of its market value, with another $15 billion in value lost from peers Twitter Inc (TWTR.N), Snap Inc (SNAP.N) and Pinterest Inc (PINS.N).

Shares of Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), which posted record quarterly sales that topped expectations on Tuesday, were down 1.3%. read more

Meta, which has the second-largest digital ad platform in the world after Google, had previously warned its advertising business faced ""significant uncertainty"" in the fourth quarter. read more

The company forecast first-quarter revenue in the range of $27 billion to $29 billion. Analysts were expecting $30.15 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Apple's changes to its operating software give users the preference to allow tracking of their activity online, making it harder for advertisers who rely on data to develop new products and know their market.

The company's total revenue, the bulk of which comes from ad sales, rose to $33.67 billion in the fourth quarter from $28.07 billion a year earlier, beating analysts' estimates of $33.40 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Net loss from Meta's Reality Labs, the company's augmented and virtual reality business, was $10.2 billion for the full year 2021, compared with a $6.6 billion loss the previous year. It was the first time the company had broken out this segment in its results.

CEO Mark Zuckerberg had previously warned that the company's investment in this area would reduce 2021 operating profit by $10 billion and would not be profitable ""any time in the near future.""

The company said on Wednesday it would this year change its stock ticker to ""META,"" the latest step in its rebrand to focus on the metaverse, a futuristic idea of virtual environments where users can work, socialize and play.

The tech giant, which changed its name in October to reflect its metaverse aims, is betting the metaverse will be the successor to the mobile internet. It did not comment on the price of a deal with Roundhill Investments, which said in January it would stop using the symbol for its Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF.

Meta's rebrand comes at a time of increasing scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators over allegations of anticompetitive conduct and over the impacts of how it handles harmful or misleading content across its Facebook and Instagram platforms. read more

""If you're putting billions up front and not really expecting return for years, shareholders are going to be hesitant,"" ABI Research analyst Eric Abbruzzese said, referring to the metaverse costs.

AMZN,AMZN Could Fly On Earnings,98,76,1643915254,"This is why I'm betting AMZN does well on earnings today AH! 

For starters, AMZN is down 6.85% at the time of writing this today, meaning, the market is already scared with what happened to (FB, NFLX, PYPL, etc...) and many investors are getting out in an effort to protect themselves if AMZN blows earnings. So, a bad earnings could be partially priced in with this decline. 

Second, AMZN blew earnings last quarter (Q3 '21) when they had a 59.4% decline in Net Income forcing a small sell off back in Oct of last year.  Now, their expectations are 50% lower than they were in Q4 of '20 ($7 EPS vs. $3.67 EPS for this quarter) so much of their slower growth/high transport cost has been priced in. 

Third, their stock is already down nearly 26% from its November high, so the likelihood of another massive correction like we saw with FB/NFLX is unlikely since investors have already sold off.  While, there is always room to go down more, if AMZN offers any kind of positive guidance, I believe the stock will do very well! 

tl;dr

While this is still a risky play since investors have not been kind to slowing growth of these companies, AMZN has done a lot of bleeding already, their EPS estimates are in the trash, and everyone is already fearful of whats to come.

Amazon (AMZN) reported fourth quarter results on Thursday and announced it will raise its Prime membership fee to $139 per year from $119 in the U.S. The stock is soaring in after-hours.

These are the top- and bottom-line results for Amazon's fourth quarter.

Earnings per share: $27.75

Revenue: $137.4 billion

This is the third time since the launch of Amazon Prime that the e-commerce giant raises prices for its yearly delivery service in the U.S. It hiked fees in 2014 and 2018 by $20 each time. The announced price change will go into effect for new members on February 18th. Existing members will see the fees upon their renewal date after March 25.

The company's net income nearly doubled last quarter compared to the same period the previous year, in large part because of the company's investment in EV startup Rivian (RIVN). Amazon reported $14.3 billion in net income for Q4, compared to $7.2 billion during the last three months of 2020.

""Fourth quarter 2021 net income includes a pre-tax valuation gain of $11.8 billion included in non-operating income from our common stock investment in Rivian Automotive, Inc., which completed an initial public offering in November,"" said the company's earnings statement.

Net sales increased 9% to $137.4 billion in the fourth quarter, compared with $125.6 billion in the same period last year.

Amazon's Web Services unit brought in $17.78 billion in revenue for the quarter, compared to expectations of $17.23 billion.

The company's 1st quarter revenue forecast is for $112 billion-$117 billion. The Street was expecting guidance of $120 billion.

MSFT,Buffett’s Berkshire bought about $1 billion worth of Activision shares before Microsoft deal,1818,406,1644893644,"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/14/buffetts-berkshire-bought-activision-stock-before-microsoft-deal.html

Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway purchased about $1 billion worth of shares in Activision Blizzard in the fourth quarter, according to a regulatory filing, jumping in before Microsoft agreed to buy the video-game publisher for $68.7 billion. Berkshire owns 14.66 million shares valued at $975 million as of the end of 2021, the filing shows. Microsoft announced its intent to acquire Activision Blizzard in mid-January for $95 per share, sending the stock up 25% to above $82, though it’s since fallen a bit. It would be the largest deal ever by a U.S. technology company.

Buffett is poised to notch a handsome profit should the deal close. The stock reached as low as $56.40 in the fourth quarter after the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing filed a suit alleging that Activision and its subsidiaries fostered a sexist culture and paid women less than men. Activision also said in November that it was delaying the releases of Diablo IV and Overwatch 2.

&#x200B;

**Chapter 1. Bull thesis (and other lies I tell myself?)**

&#x200B;

Let's start with the typical bull thesis. The one you have probably encountered many times in the wilderness of reddit or twitter. It goes like this:

&#x200B;

* Tesla's car sales will grow 50% annually for foreseeable future. Eventually reaching annual production rate of 20M by 2030. Source: [Technoking himself](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1310486616075579393)

&#x200B;

* Net margins will stay as high or even grow further from the latest 13.1% (Q4 2021). Commonly cited reasons are 4680, Gigacasting... maybe even Alien Dreadnought?

&#x200B;

* Tesla is a tech company. They will generate tons of revenue by selling software such as ~~Fraud~~ Full-Self-Driving, and might eventually launch their own marketplace (see AppStore).

&#x200B;

* Tesla is... *ETF**?* (cannot add a link to youtube video, but it is from solving the money problem)

&#x200B;

* Tesla ~~sex~~bot. Enough said.

&#x200B;

Let's start with an automotive sales part:

&#x200B;

* Say Tesla is such Gigachad^(TM) that it reaches 20M sales without reducing the prices or introducing the cheaper model(s). According to Q4 2021 Financial Report, current **ASP is $50.7K**, derived as auto revenue excl. regulatory credits divided by the number of delivered cars. Assuming 3% average inflation for the next 9 years (incl. current spike) the ASP in 2030 would be **$66.2K** (50.7 x 1.03\^9)

&#x200B;

* With **net margins of 13%** that would result in **66.2K x 20M x 0.13 = $172B net income**.

&#x200B;

* Eventually growth by 2030 will taper and converge to automotive industry average. As of writing, PEs of auto peers: Toyota - 9.64, Volkswagen - 6.88, Ford - 10.10, GM - 7.10, BMW - 4.75. But Tesla being Tesla, so we award an automotive **Tesla PE of 15**.

&#x200B;

* Tesla market cap by end 2030 is (drum roll...) **172B x 15 = 2.58T**. An absolute automotive leader with 20M sales at an average price of 66.2K USD, with outstanding operating margins (\~twice the industry average), with PE 15 (approximately twice the industry average) will triple from the current valuation (or double from January 3's)?

&#x200B;

* Taking an average of 7% market growth leads to Net Present Value (NPV) of 2.58T / 1.07\^9 = **1.4T\*,** so *...* Tesla on January 3rd was pretty fairly valued? Although why would anyone invest in a single stock for a 7% growth versus investing into SPY?

&#x200B;

* From the other angle, if you invest in TSLA now (market cap of 890B as of writing) it will return you (2.58 / 0.89)\^(1/9) = 1.125 or **12.5% annually**. Not too shabby, but also anything but impressive in contrast to its growth in the last two years.

&#x200B;

But careful observer would remind me that we are talking about *Tech* company and not an *Auto* company. But before we go there... let's discuss what is wrong with the bull thesis above.

&#x200B;

**Chapter 2. Automotive market.**

&#x200B;

Many analyses that I have read address future volumes only from the perspective of the supply. Analyses argue that the ramp up of the existing factories plus the introduction of new ones can support 50% growth, eventually reaching 20M car sales by 2030. What they often fail to address is the total addressable market (TAM), which is in our case the EV market in 2030. To be clear, below we will include both plug-in hybrids (PHEV) and battery electric vehicles (BEV) as parts of the EV market. The main reasoning is that for a wide target audience PHEV covers 95% of all use-cases (daily trips within a city) with electric power, therefore creates a real alternative to buying BEV (what happened to me and my wife personally). 

&#x200B;

No doubt the EV market will be enormous by 2030. In particular:

&#x200B;

* EU proposes to ban new ICE cars by 2035 ([source](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/eu-proposes-effective-ban-new-fossil-fuel-car-sales-2035-2021-07-14/)). Citation: ""... if the EU raised its CO2 emission reduction targets to 50% by 2030, it would bring new fossil-fuel car sales across the bloc down to virtually zero by then... Brussels also proposed allowing plug-in hybrids to count as low-emission vehicles up to 2030 ..."". From this we can assume **EV penetration rate of a 100% in EU by 2030.**

&#x200B;

* China plans to transition 40% vehicles sales to so-called ""New Energy vehicles"" (that include plug-in hybrids, fuel cells, and battery electric vehicles) by 2030 ([source](https://www.autonews.com/china/china-explores-ambitious-goal-ev-sales-2035)). So **EV penetration rate in China of 40% by 2030.**

&#x200B;

* and USA target half of all vehicles sold in 2030 in US to be electric (also includes plug-in hybrids, [source](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/05/climate/biden-tailpipe-emissions-electric-vehicles.html)), i.e. **50% EV penetration rate for the US by end 2030**

&#x200B;

* The rest of the World mostly do not have any plans for phasing-out Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) cars ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-out_of_fossil_fuel_vehicles)). Anecdotally, when I visited my hometown of 300K population (in former USSR country) last winter I couldn't locate a single EV, whereas they are common in European city where I live now. We will make an assumption of **20% EV penetration rate for the rest of the world.**

&#x200B;

2019 automotive sales by region as a percentage of the global are as follows ([source](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/passenger-car-sales-by-key-region-2010-2020e)): China - 26.5%, EU - 25.3%, US - 18.0%, Rest of the World - 30.2%. By taking into account assumptions on regional EV penetrations rate, we obtain: 0.265 x 0.4 + 0.253 x 1.0 + 0.180 x 0.5 + 0.302 x 0.2 = **0.509 or 50.9% global EV penetration rate.**

&#x200B;

The next step is to evaluate total car sales in 2030. There are various forecasts, however most of them are in the same ballpark. According to ResearchAndMarkets ([source](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211014005505/en/Global-Automotive-Market-COVID-19-Growth-Forecast-2020-2030---ResearchAndMarkets.com)) global automotive sales should reach **122.8M units by 2030.** Worth noting that global automotive sales did not practically rise since 2016. Yet most of the research firms keep 2030 target by adjusting CAGR, which I personally find as an unlikely scenario. Especially with the recent inflation, chip shortage, supply chain and other issues.

&#x200B;

Nevertheless, by multiplying forecasted global automotive sales to global EV penetration rate we obtain **62.5M EV cars (PHEV + BEV) to be sold in 2030.** It is important to understand that this is a **bullish estimate rather than the base.** First of all, we applied a very rude global level calculation. To be more accurate we need to apply analysis on the regional levels. In particular, auto sales for the rest of the World and China are expected to grow much faster than in the EU region. Therefore, lower EV penetration rate of the former (20% and 40%) relative to the latter (100%) would result in the lower global EV sales by 2030 than we estimated. Second, it is clear by commentary of the experts and the press that the aforementioned phase-out plans are ambitious and can be taken as a stretch targets. Elon in 2020 himself believed that the global BEV market would only be 30M by 2030 ([source](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1310486616075579393)).

&#x200B;

**Chapter 3. Tesla's market share.**

&#x200B;

From [EV-Volumes.com](https://EV-Volumes.com), we can take the annual global EV sales for the past years. It's easy to estimate Tesla's market share from this graph:

* 2018: 245K / 2082K = **11.8%**
* 2019: 367K / 2276K = **16.2%**
* 2020: 500K / 3240K = **15.4%**
* 2021: 936K / 6750K = **13.9%**

&#x200B;

Not to raise an alarm, but it looks like Tesla's market share peaked at 16.2% and already started to decay. Two years is a bit short of a timeframe to make conclusions on the trend. But it is difficult to restrain yourself from making a connection between the loss of Tesla's market share and ramp up of Chinese OEMs, VW (id family), and wide range of PHEV from legacy.

&#x200B;

For 2030, in my most bullish view Tesla can at most maintain its 13.9% market share. Take into account the combination of increasing aforementioned competition and almost nonexistent roadmap of Tesla. To elaborate, Tesla has in production four models (two original designs from aesthetics perspective - head and tail lamps, bumpers, interior, etc.) - Model S/X and Model 3/Y. Cybertruck is expected to launch soon, however according to Elon himself, the target for CT is a mere 250K annual production.

&#x200B;

Model S/X is already a 10-years old design (except for the front facelift and an interior update). Model 3/Y's original design is 5-years old with no major updates yet. Given the 4-5 year median time between announcements and production of Tesla, we should not expect any new mass production model(s) before 2026. Especially given an already long pipeline of unfinished projects (Cybertruck, Roadster - niche product, Semi, etc.). By that time Model 3/Y would be 9 year old design (comparable to the current state of Model S/X).

&#x200B;

We have observed firsthand what such aging without any major updates might mean for the sales. Since 2018 combined sales of Model S/X dropped from 101.5K to 24.4K in 2021 (it was going down consistently for all the previous years as well, so do not attribute overall drop just to a model refresh). It is not difficult to understand why. When someone buys a new car for $100K, that person wants to make sure that people around recognize it as a new car for $100K and not say 10-year old used one for the price of $30K.

&#x200B;

So in order for Tesla to keep up the market share it needs to step up its game in introducing new models and doing major updates for existing ones. If people will start considering Model 3/Y to be rather outdated, the demand will fall off the cliff as we have seen with Model S/X. The fall of Model S/X can be attributed to the release of Model 3/Y. But unlike in 2017, there are far more alternatives now to the aging Model 3/Y as well.

&#x200B;

Despite all that, let's consider Tesla will sustain its 13.9% market share through 2030. Recall our estimates on EV global sales of 62.5M in 2030 and we obtain **8.7M Tesla cars to be sold in 2030.** This is whopping **56.5% lower** than in the original bull thesis, and will respectively lead to a **TSLA valuation of 1.12T USD in 2030.** An **annual return of 2.5% (below inflation)** if you invest at current prices.

&#x200B;

**Chapter 4. ASP**

&#x200B;

Perhaps for Teslanaires throwing $50K at a car is no big deal, but for most people said $50K is actually big money. If Tesla wants to sell 8.7M cars it needs to either (or preferably both) reduce the ASP of existing model lines or introduce cheaper ones. Especially given the aforementioned points on increasing competition, poor roadmap and aging line-up.

&#x200B;

8.7M correspond to 7.1% of the total projected car sales in 2030. Only two brands (note, not manufacturers) had comparable market shares in 2020, namely Toyota with 8.5% and Volkswagen with 7.8% respectively ([source](https://www.statista.com/statistics/316786/global-market-share-of-the-leading-automakers/)). It is only logical to assume that the price distribution of Tesla cars should follow that of a Toyota or Volkswagen rather than, for example, Mercedez-Benz (3.1%) or BMW (2.7%). Neither Toyota Motor Corporation nor Volkswagen Group do not break down the sales and revenues by brands. We will take Toyota as an example as it only contains 2 major brands (Toyota and Lexus) in contrast to 5 major brands of Volkswagen (Volkswagen, Audi, Skoda, Seat and Porsche).

&#x200B;

According to the latest [Toyota Financial report](https://global.toyota/pages/global_toyota/ir/financial-results/2022_3q_presentation_en.pdf) (Q1-Q3 combined) **ASP of Toyota car is 3.8M yen or 33K USD**, estimated by dividing automotive revenue of 23.3T yen by car deliveries of 6.1M. In reality these 23.3T yen also included financial services, and 6.1M deliveries also include Lexus, but it's a good enough approximation. Under the assumption that Tesla can dictate $5K premium for the same market share, **Tesla's 2030 ASP is $49.5K** (38K x 1.03\^9) or **25% lower** than the original bull thesis assumption of $66K.

&#x200B;

Deducting these extra 25% results in **TSLA valuation by end 2030 of $840B**, or **-0.7%** **annual return if you invest today**. See the discrepancy between these numbers and 3-10T valuations TSLAnalysts target for as soon as 2025? And they often claim that nothing other than auto sales are included in their models.

&#x200B;

**Margins.**

&#x200B;

One topic I will not touch in this post is net margins, as it deserves its own DD. For now we assumed the same margins in all of the cases. In fact, lower ASP (e.g. cheaper models), increasing number of service centers (to keep up with production), etc. would definitely put a pressure on margins. On the other hand Tesla investments in Gigacasting and structural batteries might (or might not) help to increase margins. Drawbacks of the latter two is lower (to none) repairability that would lead to higher warranties costs. As I said, the topic deserves its own DD.

&#x200B;

**Chapter 5. Share dilution or Twitter polls**

&#x200B;

When we discuss the share price we should also touch such concept as *share dilution.* Even if Elon personally says enough and stops diluting shareholders via his out-of-this-universe bonus plans. Note that for the last 5 years alone number of outstanding shares increased from 0.8B to 1.12B ([source](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TSLA/tesla/shares-outstanding)), and to my understanding that might not yet include non-executed options of Elon (experts please weigh in).

&#x200B;

Due to the expected high-growth, i.e. ramp ups of existing ~~factories~~ Gigafactories and introduction of new models, Tesla is unlikely to offer stock buybacks until 2030. And even if we assume that Tesla will not raise any more funds either, share dilution will still take place via employee stock compensations alone.

&#x200B;

A good comparison would be Amazon, unlike Microsoft or Apple who offer a lot of buybacks. For the last 7 years Amazon experienced an average share dilution of 1.1% ([source](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMZN/amazon/shares-outstanding)). Needless to say this is a bullish target for a company in a more infancy stage such as Tesla. Applying average of 1.1% over the course of 9 years (end of 2030) brings **total share dilution to 10.3%** (1.011\^9).

&#x200B;

On top of that, Elon demonstrated that not only he loves to bonus compensations, he is open to sell them, i.e. increase the *float.* Which is in short to mid term is even more important for a stock price than outstanding shares as it increases the supply on the open market. But in shouldn't play a role in theory for the long term (again, in theory).

&#x200B;

**The results:**

&#x200B;

If I would want to invest in Tesla now, such that it returns me in average annually 10% (vs 7% average of SPY) and we apply:

* our estimated target for market cap of **840B USD**, 
* and take into account bullish 10.3% share dilution, 

Tesla should not be valued more than: 840 / 1.1\^9 / (1.103) **= 323B USD today**

&#x200B;

Or with the current number of outstanding shares: 323B / 1.123B = **287 USD per share today**

&#x200B;

For Tesla bulls: before you say it's outrageous, note how this model still results in $TSLA current market cap equivalent of Toyota and way bigger than VW group. And all that due to the high expectations of growth alone. However, **expectations of high growth over the long timeframe involves a lot of risks, that we didn't even account for.**

&#x200B;

**Chapter other product lines of Tesla:**

&#x200B;

As for the other product lines, it's difficult to judge them now as they are in their infancy. Solar installation seems to be dropping since the days of SolarCity ([source](https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2018/05/03/tesla-energy-storage-deployments-way-up-solar-slows-further/)). Since 2018 solar installations seems to be recovering and the energy storage seems to be increasing (source: latest quarterly report). However, it is clear from the financial statements that both of these businesses lose money already on the gross margin level. In particular, Tesla reported Automotive Gross margins of 29.3% and *Total* Gross margins of 25.3%.

&#x200B;

How a company exactly calculates gross expenses might differ, but losing money on the gross margin is rarely a good sign. It often means that the costs of goods sold already exceeds the selling price. Think of it as Tesla spending $100 to buy solar tiles, another $50 for shipping, and $200 for labor to install it, whereas only sells it for $250 to a customer. On top of that there are operational expenses that include general management and accounting, engineers, marketing, their bonuses, office expenses, etc. that affect Operating margins.

&#x200B;

The TAM of storage and solar by 2030 is debatable. It is clear however, that the biggest solar companies in the world ([source](https://www.investopedia.com/10-biggest-solar-companies-5077655)) have valuations of just few billions. So adding 100s of billions to Tesla's valuation based on Solar business is unreasonable. I bet the same holds for energy installation business.

&#x200B;

**Chapter Hype: Fraud Self Driving**

&#x200B;

This one is the closest to my heart. Disclaimer, I work for the top automotive semiconductor company and contribute to automotive sensors for high-level autonomy. And by proxy, I also have some understanding of the post-processing side of things, what Silicon Valley folks refer to as Machine Learning, Sensor Fusion, Behavioral Planning, etc. So I could probably write the whole DD just related to this topic, but instead I will try to keep this chapter simple. No discussions on the strategy, sensor suits, architectures. We will only talk about simple concept - *disengagements.*

&#x200B;

Since Tesla doesn't share any statistics on disengagements of FSD, we can only rely on the videos coming from the OG Tesla ~~shills~~ beta-testers. If you explore the prairies of Youtube you will encounter hundreds, if not thousands, of FSD videos. At first, you would be even impressed. But we fellow investors should not mix emotions with raw numbers.

&#x200B;

After your careful research you would realize that (anecdotally) average disengagement rate is about 1 disengagement per 1-5 miles. Elon's statements on Tesla being on the path of marching nines is heavily misleading. If you think emotionally, a car driving all by itself for 1 to 5 mile is an impressive feat. And maybe it is, which is not an achievement of Tesla per se, but the whole industry since the days of Darpa's challenges and even before.

&#x200B;

But if we think practically, we realize that 1-5 miles is too short of a distance. In average US driver drove 14000miles in 2019 ([source](https://www.kbb.com/car-advice/average-miles-driven-per-year/)). For the sake of the argument, let's say that not all FSD disengagements would have led to lethal accidents if not taken. Be it 10%... f\*\*k it, say 1%. That is still 1 lethal accident per 100-500 miles. Or 28 - 140 lethal accidents per year. Would you trust a system to drive you or your loved one home, if you know that the system will try to (or successfully) kill you every second week or even day.

&#x200B;

If Tesla reduces disengagement rate from there by 100, You still end up with 0.28 - 1.4 dangerous disengagement per year. That's where the big problem starts to appear. Since a car is NOT trying to kill you for 364 days in a year, you start to become complacent and that's where the first accidents will happen. After few lethal accidents people perhaps will become very cautious again.

&#x200B;

Fast forward, Tesla reduces disengagement rate by another factor of 100. Now it's one lethal accident in 100-300 years! Tesla so far produced 2.5M cars with FSD take rate of 10%, i.e. 250K wild FSDs out there. And that results *still* in 830 to 2500 lethal accidents per year due to FSD.

&#x200B;

And that is how marching nines looks like. When Tesla will fight against statistics as people will get more and more complacent. But we are long way from this.

&#x200B;

**Chapter Hype: To be continued...**

&#x200B;

I could also rant about 4680, Gigacasting, vertical integration. Especially on the last topic I have something to say from semiconductor perspectives (given Tesla's ambitions with FSD chip and DoJo). But all of these topics I might include in some other DD later on.

&#x200B;

**Chapter History.**

&#x200B;

A bit of a detour into a history of stock market. I like to compare Tesla to C*isco*. Just like Tesla, Cisco was **the** ***stonk*** **in 2000**. Cisco actually was the **World's biggest** company by market cap with a valuation of 500B, adjusted to inflation - 800B. But that number makes no justice to what Cisco was. In 2000 the World GDP was about 34B vs 84B now (source: [statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/268750/global-gross-domestic-product-gdp/)), SPY was around 150 vs 470 now. So, Cisco price was equivalent to 1.25 to 1.5T of today's dollars.

&#x200B;

And yet, market analysts did claim that Cisco still had a lot of room to grow. For instance, [this bloomberg article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/1999-09-13/cisco-could-be-the-safest-net-play-around) claims Cisco was the safest Net play back then. And another [nice fella from Credit Suisse believed](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/stories/2000/03/20/story2.html) Cisco will be valued at 1T in just a few years! 1T of 2000 dollars no less. Does such claims sound familiar? At the time of the article, 37 investment banks rated it buy or strong buy, and NONE sell or even hold! By the way, article was released on 19 March 2000. See how they almost perfectly timed the top?

&#x200B;

By looking at CSCO all-time chart you can see how the story ended. In 20 years the price haven't recovered to it's ATH. Add to that how much market has grown, inflation, and you will realize that the real returns are much worse than -28%. Nowadays Cisco is the real solid company with a current valuation of 230B and PE ratio of 20. The problem is it was just too overvalued and too overhyped around 2000. Was Cisco a part of the future back in 2000? Absolutely. But sometimes you need to ask yourself how much that future is worth.

&#x200B;

It doesn't really matter whether Tesla is 1-5-10 years ahead of competition. What matters is how much that lead actually worth?

&#x200B;

**Conclusion**

&#x200B;

My conclusion results that the bullish target for TSLA is 287USD. I am not a financial advisor so only you yourself are responsible for you financial decisions.

&#x200B;

P.S. Fun fact, $TSLA is valued at approx. $890B / 2.5M = $356K per every car Tesla ever sold (it was $480K per car as late as January 3). When Hertz ""announced"" 100K order from Tesla, $TSLA jumped around $400K per every car. This creates an interesting philosophical question: didn't we just discover perpetuum mobile? You can buy a Tesla car from a wealth generated by $TSLA which in fact would increase the value of former even more. Could it be that all Tesla buyers are former or current $TSLA holders? khm....

AAPL,6 reasons why AAPL isn't a pandemic stock,62,90,1645496866,"**tldr:** Pandemic stocks had no fundamental changes to their services and products in the last 2 years. AAPL had some substantial changes that came during the pandemic.

It makes a lot of sense that a lot of companies are normalizing back to pre-pandemic values because people are slowly easing back to normal life. This has led to crashes of 20-80% for many companies.

AAPL is still up \~100% since the pandemic. What are the reasons why AAPL won't drop back down too?

Here are my 6 reasons:

* **People severely underestimated how much impact the Trump administration destroying Huawei phones had on Apple.** Apple benefited hugely as people bought iPhones instead of Huawei. In China, Apple is now the #1 smartphone maker again. Two years ago, I would have said this is impossible because of how strong Chinese phone makers have been and have been growing. In hindsight, the moment Trump announced the ban was the moment AAPL should have exploded.
* **5G super-cycle** came during the pandemic
* **Superior supply-chain management during the pandemic allowed Apple to gain permanent market shares.** In the US, the iPhone has surpassed Android in marketshare and is accelerating, which I thought would never happen again.
* **Mac transitioned to Apple Silicon during the pandemic**, which is beating the pants off Intel and AMD chips in performance and performance per watt. Apple is now the fastest-growing computer maker and they're just getting started. The PC market is $150b/year, and Apple only has an 8% market share. If Apple is able to go up to 20 to 30%, that's a very respectable increase in revenue.
* **Apple is expected to eventually enter some of the hottest markets during the pandemic** which were electric vehicles, self-driving cars, and the metaverse. While existing companies in those markets have dropped off, Apple hasn't even released a product for them yet. This means AAPL never actually caught the hype for these categories during the pandemic.
* **Investors never really caught onto Apple's new strategy until recently which involves gaining market share and selling services.** Apple is no longer just serving the premium markets. The old saying ""Apple products are overpriced"" is no longer true. For $330, you can buy a new iPad. $250 and get the iPhone SE. $400 and get an iPhone SE. And I'm guessing Apple is planning a cheap Macbook SE to take PC market share too. These are excellent value products and serve as the entry points into Apple's iron grip ecosystem. Once you're in with one product, you can't get out. Next thing you know, you're buying Airpods every 2 years, subscribing to Apple Music, getting Apple Fitness+, upgrading to a Macbook Pro, using Apple Pay which gives Apple a % of the transaction, buying virtual items in stupid mobile games, etc...",0.75,0,0.111127946,0.055563973,22-02-2022 02:27,161.8776855,150.1974945,129.085495,281.0265503,273.8433228

AMZN,Amazon's Stock Split Explained [$AMZN],205,81,1647189256," **Amazon's Stock Split Explained \[for any new investors, or investors of $AMZN\]:**

&#x200B;

* Amazon is the latest tech giant to announce a stock split, following Apple, Tesla, and Google.
* This is Amazon's first stock split in over 20 years, and historically, stock split announcements have often triggered short-term rallies
* Amazon's 20-for-1 stock split means that you’ll receive 20 shares for each share you currently own
* Today, one share of Amazon stock is about $3,000, which means, the price would drop to around $150 per share
* Mathematically, stock splits don't create any ""new value"" for owners, or fundamentally change anything about a company. Stock Splits are a marketing maneuver, aimed at making a high-priced stocks more attractive to retail investors, who might consider buying it. Stock splits also make options contracts more affordable for retail investors.
* My prediction is that Amazon will also be added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Apple, announced a 7-for-1 stock split in 2014, which brought it from over $600 a share, to less than $100 per share, and it joined the Dow in 2015.
* Adding high-priced shares to the Dow is problematic because the index is price weighted, meaning the same percentage move matters more for a high priced stock than a low priced one.
* This is Amazon's first stock split since 1999, and the fourth since Amazon’s IPO in 1997. Amazon did a 2-for-1 split on June 2, 1998; a 3-for-1 split on Jan. 5, 1999; and a 2-for-1 split on Sept. 2, 1999.
* Amazon shares are up over 4,300% since the last split was announced.
* Google announced a 20-for-one split in February, Apple announced a 4-for-1 split in August 2020, Tesla announced a 5-to-1 split on August 2020 (Nvidia announced a 4-to-1 split in July 2021.)
* AMZN will begin trading at its new split-adjusted price on Monday, June 6, 2022.",0.9,0,0.188746556,0.094373278,13-03-2022 16:34,152.4302063,145.5245056,130.1558533,273.5545044,265.1166687

AAPL,AAPL is now less than 5% off of its highs,207,174,1648154338,"I guess I'm just interested in hearing from those who are bullish on AAPL at its current price, because I find this hard to understand.

AAPL is now trading a 29 PE which is really high given they're growing slower than the other mega cap tech names, and until very recently would trade with a PE in the mid teens. On the other hand AAPL has a solid balance sheet and they continue to return profits to shareholders via buybacks. I can understand why investors might want to own a company like AAPL given the economic uncertainties, but I'm not sure it's worth a 29 PE multiple. It looks like a stock that should trade with a PE multiple in the low 20s to me.

A lot has changed since AAPL last traded at this level. To name a few: RU invaded UA. The 10 year yield is almost percentage point higher. Europe looks likely to enter recession. Gas prices and other commodity prices have spiked higher. Inflation appears to be more persistant than originally thought. And the FED will likely need to tighten more aggressively than previously anticipated.

Given economic conditions have deteriorated since, what's the reasoning for AAPL to be trading near ATHs again?

Anyways how much upside is really left in AAPL short term? Maybe $200 if we're REALLY lucky.  And then it won't stay there all year!

So I've decided to sell all my shares and buy them back after we correct another 25 to 50% after fed hits the brakes on balance sheet.

Someone said once FED starts reducing balance sheet we're gonna fall maybe 25 to 50%.  Some people are saying the sp500 will go down maybe 90% ..... Dan Niles I think said it.

Today Dan said that we should be 100% cash. I'm 30% cash and hopefully can get to maybe 50% or a little more for the Fed correction.

Anyways I like AAPL long term but if its gonna go to $100 or lower .... Someone online said AAPL may hit $50 a share this summer.... Then id rather cash out tax free now and buy back in for more shares at $100 or even $50 if I'm really lucky!

If I were to purchase and then it drops to $250 (long shot short term I'd say) then I could just hold.

MSFT,"Out of NVDA, GOOGL, and MSFT, which one do you think will have the best future in the next five years?",152,173,1649880980,"Assuming you can only buy one of the three and that you are not interested in something like QQQ.  Also assume that one already has other plays like value, oil, etc.  e.g. I am not asking if these stocks are overpriced and if we should instead buy CVX or HAL, etc.

NVDA has AI, which appears to still be at an early stage and has unrealized potential.  However, it is unclear how much of that potential is real and how much is hype.  If we get a bear market, NVDA will drop but might come back once the AI potential is realized, especially if the AI is needed for the event triggering the bear market (e.g. making smart weapons to combat Russia, accelerating green technologies to combat climate change, etc.).

GOOGL also has AI and some other plays like Waymo, but GOOGL remains mostly advertising.  If we do get a recession or a bear market, GOOGL could get hit hard and might also be slower to recover.

MSFT seems the most stable of the three, but I'm not sure if the growth will be as high going forward.  Seems like most businesses already use Office and while MSFT could raise the price, there does not appear to be as much expansion in terms of brand new accounts.

GOOG,Some stocks are looking downright irresistible,956,691,1652384713,"I'm not making any moves yet, but I'm getting my shopping list ready and there are some absolutely crazy values out there right now.

1. PYPL - Currently trading at a price it hasn't seen since 2018, and is at the lowest P/E in its entire history. The last time the P/E was anywhere near this low was back in 2016. At that time PYPL's EPS was $1\`.11. It's now at $3.03. So it's trading at levels not seen in years but is earning triple what it was earning back then.
2. GOOG - Currently trading at the lowest P/E in more than 7 years. It came close to this level back in 2019, when it was earning $49.50/share. It's now earning $110.50, more than double what it was earning then.
3. DOCU - Currently trading at a P/S of 6.3. The last time it was at this sales ratio was back in 2019, pre-COVID. At that time it was generating $7.84/share in revenue. It's now generating $10.70/share. Gross margins are higher now too.
4. CHWY - Currently trading below its IPO price at the dirt cheap P/S of 1.1. The previous lowest P/S was 3.2, back at the IPO when it was generating $13.40/share in revenue. It's now generating $21.30/share in revenue on higher gross margins.

Bottom line: there are some companies out there trading at or below past levels despite generating considerably more earnings or sales now than they were back then. The unprofitable ones will rebound more slowly, but these are the higher quality companies that the smart money will start snapping up when it looks like the dust is settling.

AMZN,What do people think of AMZN?,97,141,1652585310,"As the title asks. I have a sizable position in the company, but it is down 40%. It is the only individual stock I own. Most of my other investments are in SPY and QQQ, with a little in mid-cap and international index funds. 

1. Its P/E is very high, especially compared to Apple, Google, MS. Some say P/E is not the right measure to compare these companies, but I am not sure why not

2. It is spending heavily on infrastructure (warehouses and cloud). Is this a continuous money sink that will always make profit margins low? Or will it at some point lead to large profits, since investments will reach a plateau?

3. I like their diversification from retail, ads, logistics, cloud, alexa, video, kuiper, etc. However I am not clear how profitable some of these endeavors are, or if they will ever be. Is this an overhang for the company?

GOOG,"Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) Analysis",744,134,1652797821,"Hey Guys whats up, this is my first analysis. I would like to get some feedback on it so give me your thoughts.

# Core Business

Google’s operations are divided in three categories: Google Services, Google Cloud and so called “Other Bets” consisting of several ventures including A.I., robotics, autonomous driving and pharmacy. As Google Services and Google Cloud generate >99% of Google’s revenue I won’t go into much detail on the “Other Bets” Category.

## Relevant Acquisitions

Through it’s acquisition activity google amassed around 250 acquisitions, expanding their research capabilities in fields like A.I., quantum computing and robotics. Below the most important ones are summarized.

**Youtube**

The most famous one of all Google acquisitions. Purchased in 2006 for 1.65 billion dollars Youtube has risen to world wide success and an unchallenged standing almost as relevant as it’s parent company. With revenues as high as 28,8 billion dollars (2021), it generates over 10% of Google’s revenue. It has proven to further expand their earnings-power besides ads with it’s Youtube Premium and Music subscription, which according to Alphabet was the major contributer to an increase of $6.3 billion in Google’s “Other Revenues” (1).

**DoubleClick**

DoubleClick was an ad service provider, who worked with advertising agencies and served major brands like Coca-Cola, GM and Microsoft. After it’s acquisition in 2008 for $3.1 billion lots of customer relations and technology was integrated into Googles ad business. In 2018 Google announced it’s plan to rebrand all ad platforms and merged DoubleClick with Googles own ad platform into the new Google Marketing Platform (2).

**Motorola Mobility**

When Google acquired Motorola in 2011, the company was struggling to gain a foothold in the smartphone business and reported the fifth straight quarter of losses. The company cost $12.5 billion dollar, Google’s largest acquisition, and was motivated as a strategic move to increase Google’s patent ownership and defend the Android operating system. After closing the deal Google sold parts of the business to Arris Group for $2.35 billion and led the smartphone division to success through a focus on high-quality entry-level smartphones. In 2014 Google sold Motorola for $2.91 billion, while keeping a major part of the patents. (3)

**Mandiant**

Google announced that Mandiant would be acquired in March 2022, to get integrated into the Google Cloud division.

**Fitbit**

Fitbit, a producer of wearable technology was acquired by Google in January 2021 and integrated into it’s hardware division.

**Nest Labs**

To expand it’s home automation business Google acquired Nest labs in 2014 for §3.2 billion and merged it with the Google Home brand in 2018 to create Google Nest.

## Industry Enviroment / Competition

**Advertising**

Through it’s search engine and Youtube, Google generates significant revenue with advertisment campaigns for it’s customers. It is unchallenged with a market share of 92% for it’s search engine and Google Chrome leading the browser market with 65% (4). Competition in it’s most relevant business is almost irrelevant for it’s earnings power and market position as most major players (Microsoft with Bing, Yahoo) have failed to attack it.

**Google Cloud**

In the highly competitive cloud computing industry Google competes with giants like Microsoft, Alibaba and Amazon. It isn’t in a leading position, but increased it’s market share from 5% (2017) to 10% (2021) with only AWS and Microsoft Azure above. (5) (6)

## Income Statement

## Revenue Growth

Google’s revenue has increased by an average of 21% annually in the last 10 years. With Growth accelerating in the past 5 years (23,3%), the question should be if similar growth can be expected in the future.

Google’s main business of advertising stands as strong as we have discussed above and with more digitilization and e-commerce growth not slowing down the market for it’s search engine and it’s ads will continue to grow. Growth projections in that business reach from 11% to 15%. (8) (9)

As Google Cloud has gained more market share in the last years and has grown it’s revenue by more than 40% on average, it’s safe to say that it will grow at least as much as the overall cloud computing industry if not more. In a recent market research report a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of over 16% was forecasted until 2026. We will take that at face value for our worst case scenario and will add to it as in a best case scenario, Google will gain more market share. (10)

|European fines|||50,17%|\-71,71%|\-100,00%||

In recent history Google was able to decrease different parts of it’s costs effectively, thus increasing profitablility. Cost of revenue is made up of \*\*\*\*traffic acquisition costs (TAC) and other revenue costs. **TAC** consists of payments made to traffic distributors, giving Google the platform and audience to advertise for it’s clients.

Other revenue costs consist of licensing fees for **acquired content** sold on YouTube and Google Play, expenses in it’s **data centers** and costs related to Google’s **hardware business**.

**Composition of cost of revenue (COR) (Table 4)**

|Cost in ($ Mio)/Year|2020|2021|
|:-|:-|:-|
|TAC|32,778|45,566|
|Other COR|51,954|65,373|
|Total COR|84,732|110,939|

With past cost development it’s important to use the studied data to make forecasts into the future regarding revenue, cost and profit development to feed our DCF model. We will look for patterns in which relation costs follow growing revenue. With the following table I will try to point that out.

||2013-2014|2014-2015|2015-2016|2016-2017|2017-2018|2018-2019|2019-2020|2020-2021|Average|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Revenue Growth|18,88%|13,62%|20,38%|22,80%|23,42%|18,30%|12,77%|41,15%|21,42%|
|COR|16,81%|9,63%|24,76%|29,73%|30,64%|20,73%|17,85%|30,93%|22,64%|
|R&D|37,76%|24,92%|13,56%|19,19%|28,84%|21,47%|5,98%|14,47%|20,77%|
|Sales and Market|24,06%|11,27%|15,89%|22,97%|26,68%|13,05%|\-2,81%|27,67%|17,35%|
|General&Admin|32,02%|4,87%|13,84%|\-1,62%|18,25%|17,54%|15,72%|22,24%|15,36%|

The cost of revenue has trailed revenue quite close and I expect it to continue to be around 40-43% of all revenue. R&D expenses have risen with revenue but have slown down in recent years. It’s not attached to revenue growth directly, but we will assume a small average growth of 10% for the upcoming years as the R&D expenses are already high enough to guarantee Google to be a potential player in all upcoming high-tech industries. Further reductions in the SGA expenses relative to revenue is possible with revenue outpacing those costs, as it has been seen in the past. Still we will assume it too be just stable to have a more conservative approach.

## Balance Sheet

## Debt Level

Google’s long term debt is almost non-existing with $15 billion. It’s earnings were >$70 billion in 2021 so it’s debt could have been paid off with just 20% of that. The company also hold’s $21 billion in cash, which makes debt for the valuation almost irrelevant.

## Capital Intensity

As Google’s business needs large amounts of land, offices and server infrastructure. Aside from large marketable securities positions, most capital is tied up in purchased land, offices and information technology assets like server farms. The company is determined to expand it’s position in that area, which will result in rising capital expenditures for both new offices and new IT assets. (1)

## Liquidation Value / Tangible Book Value

To calculate the Tangible Book Value I will use the most recent book value and exclude all assets I think are intangible. TBV calculation in $billion:

|Book Value|254,004|
|:-|:-|
|\-Goodwill|\-23,010|
|\-Property and Equipment|\-104,218|
|\-Other non-current assets|\-5,778|
|TBV|120,998|

Note: I didn’t exclude smaller positions as it would make the formular unnecessarilly large with no real effect. It’s also quite reasonable as normally the Property and Equipment of Google of cause could be sold for at least a fraction of the audited value.

Google has a TBV per share of: $120998 million / 673.22 million shares = $179,73 per share

## Cashflow Statement

IT assets generally have a high turnover frequence which results in short depreciating periods (4-5 years). The replacement makes up a large portion of the $24.6 billion of capital expenditures, which are needed for the business operation.

Still Google has great liquidity through it’s short-term marketable securities and it’s large cash reserves.

With almost over $60 billion dollar of free cashflow, Google used most of it ($50 billion) to make stock repurchases. Still the company has only really started to do repurchases in the last 4-5 years and because of it’s high valuation the amount of shares outstanding has only decreased by 5% in 3 years, which is quite a disappointment (11). $15 billion were paid in stock compensation and to account for that we won’t add it back into the DCF-valuation even though it’s a non-cash expense.

## Other

## Insider Trading / Ownership

Insider Trading has no significance for Google as high management only sold insignificant portions of their ownership. (12)

The founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin still have small stakes in the company of around 3% each, even though they slowly continue to sell them off. There is also no insider with a significant stake in the company. (12)

## Risks

* Lower advertising spending by customers
* Google’s value for it’s customers could decline
* Competition disrupting the occupied markets

## DCF Model

Summary of the Assumptions made:

* The revenue of Google Services will increase with the projected growth of the overall market of 11%-15%, which is conservative as parts like Youtube are growing at much higher rates
* Google Cloud’s revenue has increased at an annual growth rate of over 40%. In a worst case scenario it will grow at a CAGR of 16% in line with it’s industry projection, but there is a real possibility of it to accelerate at the current rate until it has gained enough size. Our worst, base and best case projection will still stay conservative at 16%-24$
* As COR is staying volatile around 45% of revenue we will assume it to stay at that level
* R&D will rise around 10% every year unrelated to revenues
* SGA (sales, general, administration) expenses will stay at the current level of 14% relative to revenues and won’t decrease any further
* capital expenses have remained quite stable at around $24 billion dollars. We will still assume an increase of 10% per year as in the most recent 10-Q report the capex has risen by over 40%.
* Depreciation rises at CapEx rate
* 2021 is not an outlier
* Share repurchases will range between 2-5% per year, as those are highly dependent on the share price

We will use a projection of the next 15 years to determine Google’s fair value in 3 scenarios at a **discount rate of 8%**

||Worst Case|Base Case|Best Case|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Google Ads CAGR|11%|13%|15%|
|Google Cloud CAGR|16%|20%|24%|
|COR|45% of total rev|“”|“”|
|R&D CAGR|10%|“”|“”|
|SGA|14% of total rev|“”|""”|
|CapEx and Depreciation|10%|“”|""”|
|Share repurchases|2%|3,5%|5%|
|Fair Value|$1690|$2518|$3805|

I would consider te base case to be highly plausible as past growth has indicated much higher growth rates. Of course it’s up to you to choose your margin of safety, but I will consider to pick up some shares if Google falls below $2000.

GOOG,"Dow drops 1,100 points for its biggest decline since 2020 as the sell-off this year on Wall Street intensifies",3137,909,1652904245,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average headed for its biggest loss since 2020 on Wednesday after another major retailer warned of rising cost pressures, confirming investors’ worst fears over rising inflation and rekindling the brutal 2022 sell-off.

The Dow shed 1,255 points, or 3.8%, or the average’s biggest decline since October 2020. The S&P 500 traded 4.3% lower, the biggest drop since June 2020. The Nasdaq Composite slipped 4.9%, the largest fall in the tech-heavy index since May 5. The selling was broad and intense on Wall Street with just 13 members of the S&P 500 in the green.

Markets returned to heavy selling after two back-to-back quarterly reports from Target and Walmart stoked investor fears of rising inflation. It’s the fifth Dow decline of more than 800 points this year, which all occurred as the stock sell-off intensified within the last one month, according to FactSet data.

“It’s clear that transportation costs matter and they’re impacting [some of] the largest companies,” said Kim Forrest, founder of Bokeh Capital. “So I think investors are scratching our heads going, ‘so, who’s next?’ And they’re giving visibility into what’s happening with the consumer.”

Target shares tumbled more than 27% Wednesday after the retailer reported first-quarter earnings that were much lower than Wall Street estimated because of higher costs for fuel and compensation. The retailer also saw lower-than-expected sales for discretionary merchandise like TVs.

The retailer’s report comes right after Walmart on Tuesday posted earnings that fell short of expectations as it too cited higher fuel and labor costs. Walmart shares ended Tuesday lower by 11%. They were down another 7% on Wednesday.

“The consumer is challenged,” said Megan Horneman, chief investment officer at Verdence Capital Advisors. “We started to see at the end of the year that consumers were turning to credit cards to pay for the rise in food prices, rise in energy prices, and that’s actually gotten much worse. ...

AAPL,"Apple (AAPL.US) continues to increase financial services, and its subsidiaries will provide loans in the future",882,246,1654740141,"Technology giant Apple ([AAPL.US](https://AAPL.US)) recently said that a wholly owned subsidiary of the company will use the Apple Pay Later service as the core in the future to verify users' credit and provide short-term loans and other services to its user base.

&#x200B;

　　Apple announced the new lending service at its developer conference (WWDC) on Monday, and the company will compete with similar services offered by Affirm ([AFRM.US](https://AFRM.US)) and PayPal ([PYPL.US](https://PYPL.US)), whose shares fell 5.5 percent by the end of the day after Apple's WWDC announcement of its Apple Pay Later product.

&#x200B;

　　Later this year, when Apple releases its new iOS 16 iPhone software, users will be able to use Apple Pay to purchase products and pay their balances in four equal installments over a period of up to six weeks through the Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) service.

&#x200B;

　　It is understood that Apple has entered into a partnership with MasterCard ([MA.US](https://MA.US)), which interacts with suppliers to offer Apple's upcoming Installments white label BNPL products. Apple says Goldman Sachs ([GS.US](https://GS.US)), the issuer of the Apple Credit Card (Apple Card), is also the technical issuer of these loans and is an official sponsor of BIN, but Apple says it is not using Goldman Sachs' credit decision system or its balance sheet to issue loans this time.

&#x200B;

　　The behind-the-scenes structure of Apple's new loan service, and the fact that the company is handling loan decisions, credit checks and lending for these loans, is indicative of the smart consumer electronics giant's financial services strategy to internalize its financial services framework and infrastructure as much as possible.

AAPL,Can AAPL get back to ATH in 4 years?,56,113,1655412989,"Mentally it’s tough to keep buying with non-stop red days. Here’s a long term perspective to consider.

AAPL is now down 30%, but a return to all time high means a 183/129 = 42% return. If you’re happy with an average annual return of 10%, then buying now means AAPL has 4 years to get back to ATH in order for it to be a good investment for you. 

Obviously a faster return to ATH gives an even better average return. (I oversimplify the math a little by ignoring compounding)

A similar analysis on these blue chips shows that a return to ATH in,

- MSFT: 4.5 years

- GOOG: 5 years

- AMZN: 8 years

Would equate to an average annual return of ~10%. 

If your time horizon is more than a few years, these are great times to be in the market.

TSLA,"Ford’s MachE – a examination of Tesla’s competition, with $TSLA implications",504,496,1656357248,"
TL/DR upfront:

Upcoming EV competition is *the* driving DD behind the Tesla bear narrative: that EV competition will show up à market competition will drive EV prices (and therefore $TSLA margins) down to industry-norms. I think this reasoning is flawed. Ford’s unprofitability with the MachE provides a window into what the competition is facing, and why Tesla is *very likely* to retain supply capped demand and see robust gross margin growth--insulated from the effects of market competition—for several years (until \~ 2026-2028). 

\---- 

Argument:

**Fords issues with EV profitabili**ty (link:  [Ford CFO says inflation has erased Mustang Mach-E profits, but isn't hurting demand (cnbc.com)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/15/ford-cfo-says-inflation-has-erased-mustang-mach-e-profits-but-isnt-hurting-demand.html) ) i**s a** **PROXY** **for legacy auto’s outlook writ large.** 

Ford’s ‘Tesla Killer’ is their Mach E, which is a BEV (full battery) crossover SUV. However, recently Ford announced that they get zero profit from sales of their Mach E. Price information is below. 

* The ‘Standard Range’ RWD (68kwh battery, 230 miles EPA range, the lowest $ base model) is $42,895 before dealer markups and delivery fees
* The ‘Extended Range’ (88kwh, 300 miles EPA, the lowest $ long range model) is $52,000 before dealer/delivery

Fords lack of Mach-E profitability is VERY interesting because the car is highly priced while also benefiting from several cost-lowering factors:

* $7,500 U.S. federal EV subsidy (Ford has yet to hit the 200,000 vehicle cap for the $7500, at which point it gradually decreases). Tesla buyers do not qualify for any EV tax credits right now. 
* Made in Mexico with cheaper, non-unionized labor 
* Usage of large pouch-style batteries, which are cheaper but lower-quality
* A more battery-efficient Car form-factor (as compared to a truck), meaning less batteries for a desired range and, therefore, lower cost of production. 

If Ford is unprofitable with a high-priced EV benefiting from $7,500, made in Mexico with lower priced components, how are they going to be profitable with the F150 Lightning? The F150 lightning will,

* Be made by Union labor at U.S. labor prices 
* Have a less-efficient form factor (truck aerodynamics are very bad)
* Have higher User battery needs (towing range). 
   * F150 lightning loses 50% of its range when towing a 23-foot airstream trailer. Add to this cold-weather battery reductions, heating needs, going up inclines…the trucks 230 mile range’s real drivable radius when towing can get extremely limited very quickly. 
* See a gradually reduced subsidy amount ($7,500 --> $3750 --> $1875) 

It is very possible that the F150 Lightning begins to see razor-thin profit margins (or none at all) over the near future. 

Additionally, Ford has additional issues it has to tackle:

* Growing percentages of EV sales will reduce dealership income (most of which is derived from maintenance and repair), leading to more pervasive markups
* A need to develop a ‘supercharging’ network. 
   * Look more deeply into their published numbers—if you nix Tesla’s superchargers (which they can access rn), as Tesla will jack up prices for non-Tesla’s over time (especially when the supercharger network begins to get overburdened), and eliminate low-power chargers, look closely in your area at the ACTUAL NUMBER of high power charging stations individually. There may be chargepoint nodes in your area, but at least in Atlanta, the total stalls are very low. 
* Battery supply shortages --> higher prices for batteries
   * This is why Fords CEO has been talking about the need for federal support with battery raw material production 

**SO WHAT?**

1.  Ford has to raise prices—they have no other choice. 
   1. None of the sub-bullets above (dealership cut, need for expanded charger network, declining subsidy $, higher priced U.S. labor, higher priced batteries with less-efficient form factors) is easily solvable. While Ford talks about separating EVs from its dealership network, that legal fight will take YEARS.  
2. This same situation will manifest in other legacy automakers 
3. Legacy auto debt levels (looking at Ford and VW, in particular) mean they can’t afford to produce less cars or see zero profit.
4. Therefore, legacy auto has significant pressure to maintain high prices
5. Tesla is, therefore, insulated from the price reduction and gross margin contracting effects of market competition. 

Add to this several Tesla-phenomena 

1. Tesla’s cost of production will continue to decline, meaning that gross margins will continue to expand 
   1. Technology reasons: dime-casting, structural battery, and 4680 (if it continues to scale) batteries 
   2. Economies of scale reasons: Tesla is centralizing serious production capacity in its main four factories. 50% CAGR can be achieved for several years with the current factory footprint alone. Austin is projected to eventually produce 2 million units alone, per year. I would doubt these projections if it wasn’t for Tesla’s record setting CAGR—which has surprised the entire industry over the past three years. 
2. Therefore, because Tesla has more ‘buffer’ to decrease prices—in an environment that is continuing to improve and in the context that legacy auto faces), Tesla has the ability to win any price war for several years into the future 

Conclusion

Tesla will be able to maintain supply capped demand for its cars and will have minimal pressure on gross margins from market competition for several years into the future. While some legacy auto (VW) MIGHT produce EVs in large numbers, this will not negatively impact Tesla gross margins. 

Would **love** for folks to put forward a strong counter argument. I have several $TSLA 2024 leaps and, if I am wrong in my assumptions here, would muuuuuch rather know that my thinking is faulty than continue to sit on this volatile position.

edit @ 622pm est. A few of you have pointed out that I am assuming tesla costs of production go down, but don't say the same for legacy. What I am trying to say here is that legacy production cost decreases HAVE to go down just to maintain current profitability levels as they lose the $7500 subsidy, begin making cars with UNIONized American labor, with (for the F150 L) less efficient form factors. No, I don't have the numbers for this because I'm not omnipotent--but consider: these are serious headwinds. 7500 is a HUGE subsidy on a 43,000 dollar car. Union labor is way, way more expensive than Mexican labor. 7500 alone is a huge moat to cross when you're not profitable with that 7500 subsidy.",0.79,0,0.041014459,0.02050723,27-06-2022 19:14,139.7595367,113.2200012,116.336792,259.3302612,244.9199982

The company does plan to use Novi’s technology in future products, such as in its metaverse project, a company spokesperson said in an email. “We are already leveraging the years spent on building capabilities for Meta overall on blockchain and introducing new products, such as digital collectibles,” Meta said in the statement. “You can expect to see more from us in the web3 space because we are very optimistic about the value these technologies can bring to people and businesses in the metaverse.”

The stock has been cut by more than half in 2022. Although Wall Street has been in a buying mood last week, real world pressures continue to make META stock one to avoid. Alternatively, if investors can’t help but like META stock at current prices, I’d similarly point to a long vertical spread using call contracts or a fully hedged collar for those interested in owning shares. But again, the belief is those efforts will be in vain and only serve the purpose of vastly reducing downside risk.

Meta Platforms has many issues to contend with. For example, Facebook Reels’ inability to challenge top rival TikTok, Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) YouTube in long form video, competition in ecommerce from Google and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), falling consumer brand value and Meta’s risky metaverse pivot, which might overlook its existing platforms.

But again, the belief is those efforts will be in vain and only serve the purpose of vastly reducing downside risk.

Meta Platforms has many issues to contend with. For example, Facebook Reels’ inability to challenge top rival TikTok, Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) YouTube in long form video, competition in ecommerce from Google and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), falling consumer brand value and Meta’s risky metaverse pivot, which might overlook its existing platforms.

TSLA,Musk terminates twitter deal,1852,626,1657316156,"https://www.reuters.com/technology/elon-musk-terminating-twitter-deal-2022-07-08/


Tesla (TSLA.O) Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said on Friday he was terminating his $44 billion deal for Twitter Inc (TWTR.N), citing material breach of multiple provisions of the agreement.

Shares of Twitter fell 6% in extended trading.

The announcement brings to an end a will-he-won't-he saga after the world's richest person clinched a deal for Twitter in April but then put the buyout on hold until the social media company proved that spam bots accounted for less than 5% of its total users.",0.95,0,-0.033333333,-0.016666667,08-07-2022 21:35,145.0673523,115.5400009,119.874115,262.0420837,250.7633362
TSLA,Was the TWTR bid by Elon just a way to hide a massive sale of TSLA Stock?,3842,746,1657650514,"Everywhere is reporting that Musk now has a ""massive windfall that dwarfs any bitcoin losses"" due to the sale of the TSLA stock to fund the TWTR deal, and as that deal is no longer going ahead, he's pockets the cash.

I'm then reminded that some shrewd analysts suggested that the divorces of Bezos and Gates to their wives were actually cover to sell massive amounts of stocks without causing a run on their companies (Founders selling huge chunks of stock usually causes investors to shit it but can be explained away for personal reasons).

I'm starting to think that Elon knows he's got a tough road ahead, the golden days of Tesla stock price are behind him and he's just liquidated massive amounts of stock at what will seem like a really high price in 10 years from now as all the big car manufacturers finally catch up and dilute Tesla's only real advantage (being first).

Here’s how the company did:

Earnings: $2.23 per share, adjusted, vs. $2.29 per share as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.

Revenue: $51.87 billion, vs. $52.44 billion as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.

During the quarter, Microsoft reduced its quarterly guidance for income and revenue because of changing foreign-exchange rates. CEO Satya Nadella said employees will get pay increases, and the company introduced services to help customers deal with security incidents.

When management lowered earnings expectations, though, it didn’t factor in other issues that could hurt results.

Technology industry researcher Gartner said earlier this month that logistical disruptions in the quarter had dragged down PC shipments, a key input for sales of Windows operating system licenses to device makers. Plus, macroeconomic worries that hurt revenue growth for advertising-driven social-media companies Snap and Twitter could rub off on Microsoft. In 2021 the company generated $10 billion in advertising revenue before traffic-acquisition costs.

Microsoft shares have sold off 25% so far this year, compared with a decline of 17% for the S&P 500 U.S. stock index.

4. The family is not paying a market price for 25% stake. In fact, they are not paying at all, because they forced VW to pay a dividend from the IPO proceeds, which the family will get by being a shareholder of VW.
5. Shares available to the public during the IPO are all non-voting.

**Long story**

The way the IPO is organized is a disgrace, and if the German government allows it to go through as is, I will have no faith in making long-term investments in German stocks anymore.

If this is legal under German laws, then I'm not buying. If this is illegal and they don't do anything, I'm not buying either.

To understand what and why is happening you need a little context, so here it is.

The Porsche family lost control of the Porsche company during the 2008 financial crisis. They wanted to buy VW but ended up in a weird financial situation where they instead had to give up control of Porsche to VW but got a controlling voting stake in VW.

The ownership structure is complicated, but in a simplified form it looks like this:

>The family -> Porsche Holdings -> VW company -> Porsche company

The IPO will make it look like this:

>The family -> Porsche Holdings -> VW company (>50% of voting rights)  
>  
>The family -> Porsche Holdings -> Porsche Company (>50% of voting rights)

The money flow is like this:

>The family “buys” 25% of voting shares from VW below market price with no competition.  
>  
>VW pays 50% of IPO proceeds as dividends.  
>  
>The family gets its money back from VW in the form of dividends.

This IPO would be a disaster even during normal times. VW is losing its best cash cow, for half the price, and the price is below market rate. But it’s happening during one of the worst times for IPOs ever. The stocks are in a global downturn, hammered by inflation, rising rates, quantitative tightening, supply chain issues, and ongoing war in Ukraine, which amplified all of the above and added energy crisis on top of that. Germany is in the worst economic situation since the fall of the Berlin wall.

This is not the right time to IPO a luxurious brand. However, this is the best time for the family to get their favorite asset out of VW. From their perspective, the less money IPO makes, the better. This conflict of interests is as bad as it gets.

IPO shares available to the public will be useless non-voting shares for gullible investors, who do not understand what they are buying. Think SNAP or GOOG. But it gets worse.

Let’s remember for a moment, that VW was not a good company for a long while. It ended up in a “diesel gate” scandal, had to pay enormous fines, as well as to change its CEO. This turned out to be a blessing in disguise, because VW got a good new CEO, had to reinvent itself by becoming more environmentally friendly, and thus started an early transition into EVs.

VW is already a top seller of EVs in Europe and rapidly growing its market share. It has a vast portfolio of cars ranging all segments, from the cheapest economy cars to the most luxurious ones, of which Porsche is the main brand. Platforms within VW are interchangeable, they use the same tech across multiple brands to achieve synergy.

Now, if you take Porsche out, these plans are thrown into disarray. On top of that, both Porsche and VW will have the same CEO, answering to the same family. Which company do you think he will prioritize more when it comes to that?

What’s more, the transition to EVs was not going smooth already. There are issues with software, which VW was never good at historically. And the labor unions were very unhappy at the potential loss of jobs (because you need less jobs to make EVs). The family seized on this opportunity to oust the CEO under a pretext that the software was delayed, and the labor unions supported the change to get their job guarantees.

The labor unions now expect to keep their jobs, meaning VW will have to keep combustion engine factories operating for longer for no economical reason. This is good for workers, but a disaster for investors in VW. The family got their IPO, which is good for them, but also a disaster for investors. And the new CEO has no experience in building software whatsoever with no sound plans to address the problems.

The right change for VW would be to hire an experienced executive VP from one of the major tech companies in the US and improve their software development culture. There was no need to change their CEO, especially considering that VW was transitioning to EVs better than all of its competitors. But, oh well.

MSFT,What's the overall sentiment around $MSFT right now? Because $MSFT social activity is rising as $MSFT dips below June lows.,47,52,1663864770,"It's the day after FOMC and markets are selling off. $MSFT, however, briefly dipped below its June lows and has since recovered, making it one of the few large-cap stocks in the green today. 

That being said, this dip below support could be a deviation before pushing higher or the beginning of much more downside ahead. Regardless, something of interest to note right now is that the number of MSFT social mentions, as tracked by LunarCrush, is showing sustained growth with more and more people creating posts and talking about Microsoft Corp (MSFT) right now at these price levels. I find this interesting because, for the first time since $MSFT's ATH back in Nov 2021, the social activity around $MSFT is trending up again, after months of trending down. 

So according to this data, there is a peak of interest in MSFT right now and it continues to grow. Whether this peak of interest in MSFT is short-sighted or long-sighted is up to interpretation but is interesting nonetheless.

What do you guys think about this? Is $MSFT's rising social activity a bullish sign? Are people fearful right now? Are they wanting to buy?

AMZN,"Facebook scrambles to escape stock’s death spiral as users flee, sales drop",1170,387,1664593516,"A year ago, before Facebook had turned [Meta](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/META), the social media company was sporting a market cap of [$1 trillion](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/28/facebook-hits-trillion-dollar-market-cap-for-first-time.html), putting it in rarefied territory with a handful of U.S. technology giants.

Today the view looks much different. Meta has lost about two-thirds of its value since peaking in September 2021. The stock is trading at its [lowest](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/16/meta-shares-plunged-14percent-this-week-falling-close-to-their-pandemic-low.html) since January 2019 and is about to close out its third straight quarter of double-digit percentage losses. Only four stocks in the [S&P 500](https://www.slickcharts.com/sp500/performance) are having a worse year.

Facebook’s business was built on network effects — users brought their friends and family members, who told their colleagues, who invited their buddies. Suddenly everyone was convening in one place. Advertisers followed, and the company’s ensuing profits — and they were plentiful — provided the capital to recruit the best and brightest engineers to keep the cycle going.

But in 2022, the cycle has reversed. [Users are jumping ship](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/02/facebook-parent-meta-fb-q4-2021-earnings.html) and advertisers are reducing their spending, leaving Meta poised to report its second straight drop in quarterly revenue. Businesses are removing Facebook’s once-ubiquitous [social login button](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/08/facebook-login-button-disappearing-from-websites-on-privacy-concerns.html) from their websites. Recruiting is an emerging challenge, especially as founder and CEO [Mark Zuckerberg](https://www.cnbc.com/mark-zuckerberg/) spends much of his time proselytizing the metaverse, which may be the company’s future but accounts for virtually none of its near-term revenue and is costing billions of dollars a year to build.

Zuckerberg [said](https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/founders-letter/) he hopes that within the next decade, the metaverse “will reach a billion people” and “host hundreds of billions of dollars of digital commerce.” He [told](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/22/mark-zuckerberg-envisions-1-billion-people-in-the-metaverse.html) CNBC’s Jim Cramer in June that the “North Star” is to reach those sorts of figures by the end of the decade and create a “massive economy” around digital goods.

Investors aren’t enthusiastic about it, and the way they’re dumping the stock has some observers questioning if the downward pressure is actually a [death spiral](https://twitter.com/heychriscurtis/status/1555934959877074944) from which Meta can’t recover.

“I’m not sure there’s a core business that works anymore at Facebook,” said Laura Martin of Needham, the only analyst among the 45 tracked by FactSet with a sell rating on the stock.

Nobody is suggesting that Facebook is at risk of going out of business. The company still has a dominant position in mobile advertising and has one of the most profitable business models on the planet. Even with a 36% drop in net income in the [latest quarter](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/27/facebook-parent-meta-earnings-q2-2022.html) from the prior year, Meta generated $6.7 billion in profit and ended the period with over $40 billion in cash and marketable securities.

The Wall Street problem for Facebook is that it’s no longer a growth story. Up until this year, that’s the only thing it’s known. The company’s slowest year for revenue growth was the pandemic year of 2020, when it still expanded 22%. Analysts this year are predicting a revenue drop.

The number of daily active users in the U.S. and Canada has fallen in the past two years, from 198 million in mid-2020 to 197 million in the second quarter of this year. Globally, user numbers are up about 10% over that stretch and are expected to increase 3% a year through 2024, according to FactSet estimates.

“I don’t see it spiraling in terms of cash flows in the next few years, but I’m just worried that they’re not winning the next generation,” said Jeremy Bondy, CEO of app marketing firm Liftoff.

Sales growth is expected to hover in the single digits for the first half of 2023, before ticking back up. But even that bet carries risks. The next generation, as Bondy describes it, is now [moving over to TikTok](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/29/tiktok-looms-large-in-tech-earnings-from-google-facebook-amazon.html), where users can create and view short, viral videos rather than scrolling past political rants from distant relatives with whom they mistakenly connected on Facebook.

Meta has been trying to mimic TikTok’s success with its short video offering called Reels, which has been a major focus across Facebook and Instagram. Meta plans to increase the amount of algorithmically recommended short videos in users’ Instagram feeds from 15% to 30%, and Bondy speculates the company will likely “get tremendous revenue flow from that” algorithmic shift.

However, Facebook acknowledges it’s early days for monetizing Reels, and it’s not yet clear how well the format works for advertisers. TikTok’s business remains opaque because the company is privately held and owned by China’s ByteDance.

[Sheryl Sandberg](https://www.cnbc.com/sheryl-sandberg/), who’s [leaving](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/01/facebook-coo-sheryl-sandberg-says-she-is-stepping-down.html) the company Friday after more than 14 years as chief operating officer, said in her final earnings call in July that videos are harder than photos in terms of ads and measurement, and that Facebook has to show businesses how to use the ad tools for Reels.

“I think it’s very promising,” Sandberg said, “but we’ve got some hard work ahead of us.”

Skeptics such as Martin see Facebook pushing users away from the core news feed, where it makes tons of cash, and toward Reels, where the model is unproven. Martin says Zuckerberg must know something important about where the business is headed.

“He wouldn’t be hurting its revenue at the same time he needs more money, unless he felt like the core business wasn’t strong enough to stand alone,” Martin said. “He must feel he has to try to move his viewership to Reels to compete with TikTok.”

A Facebook spokesperson declined to comment for this story.

Zuckerberg has at least one major reason for concern beyond just stalled user growth and a slowing economy: [Apple](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL).

The 2021 iOS privacy update, called App Tracking Transparency, undermined Facebook’s ability to target users with ads, costing the company an estimated [$10 billion](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/02/facebook-says-apple-ios-privacy-change-will-cost-10-billion-this-year.html) in revenue this year. Meta is counting on artificial intelligence-powered advertising to eventually make up for Apple’s changes.

That may amount to little more than a Band-Aid. Chris Curtis, an online marketing expert and consultant, has seen social networks rise and fall as trends change and users move along. And that problem isn’t solvable with AI.

“I’m old enough, and I was there when MySpace was a thing,” said Curtis, who previously worked at [Anheuser-Busch](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BUD) and McKinsey. “Social networks are switchable, right?”

When you look at Meta’s user numbers, Curtis said, they suggest the company is “not in a good position.”

## ‘Force for good or evil’

The last time Facebook’s market cap was this low, it was early 2019 and the company was dealing with the continued fallout of the [Cambridge Analytica](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/10/facebook-cambridge-analytica-a-timeline-of-the-data-hijacking-scandal.html)privacy scandal. Since then, Facebook has suffered further reputational damage, most notably from the documents leaked last year by whistleblower and former employee [Frances Haugen](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/04/facebook-whistleblower-reveals-identity-ahead-of-60-minutes-interview.html).

The main takeaway from the Haugen saga, which preceded the name change to Meta, was that Facebook knew of many of the harms its products caused kids and was unwilling or unable to do anything about them. Some U.S. senators compared the company to [Big Tobacco](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/30/senators-say-facebook-used-big-tobacco-playbook-to-exploit-kids.html).

[Denise Lee Yohn](https://deniseleeyohn.com/), author of brand-building books including “What Great Brands Do” and “Fusion,” said there’s little evidence to suggest that Facebook’s rebranding to Meta late last year has changed public perception of the company.

“I think the company still suffers from a lot of criticism and skepticism about whether they are a force for good or evil,” Yohn said.

Rehabilitating a damaged brand is difficult but not impossible, Yohn said. She noted that in 2009, [Domino’s Pizza](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/DPZ) was able to successfully come back from a crisis. In April of that year, a video made as a [prank](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/16/business/media/16dominos.html) by two restaurant employees went viral, showing one of them doing disgusting acts with food while cooking in one of the company’s kitchens. Both employees were arrested and charged with food contamination.

In December 2009, Domino’s launched a marketing blitz called the [“Pizza Turnaround.”](https://blog.unincorporated.com/dominos-brand-crisis) The stock climbed 63% in the first quarter of 2010.

Yohn said the company’s approach was, “We’ve been told our pizzas suck, and so we’re actually going to make substantive changes to what we are offering and change people’s perceptions.” While it sounded initially like “just marketing speak,” Yohn said, “they actually really did change.”

Zuckerberg, on the other hand, is not “coming across as a leader who is serious about changing his culture and about changing himself and about kind of creating a company that will be able to step into the future that he’s envisioning,” she said.

Meta’s reputational hit could also harm the company’s ability to recruit top-tier talent, a stark contrast to a decade ago, when there was no more prized landing spot for a hotshot engineer.

A former Facebook ad executive, who spoke on condition that his name not be used, told CNBC that even though TikTok is owned by a Chinese parent, it now has an edge over Meta when it comes to recruiting because it’s viewed as having less “moral downside.”

[Ben Zhao](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~ravenben/), a computer science professor at University of Chicago, said he’s seeing that play out on the ground as an increasing number of students in his department are showing interest in working for TikTok and ByteDance.

In order to stay competitive, given how the market has punished tech stocks this year, Zhao said, Meta and [Google](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL) are “having to pay more and are having certainly to hand out more lucrative stock options and packages.”

## The bull case

Still, Zuckerberg has a history of proving his doubters wrong, said Jake Dollarhide, the CEO of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

Dollarhide remembers when investors ran from Facebook not long after its 2012 IPO, scoffing at the company’s ability to move “from the PC to the mobile world.” Facebook’s mobile business quickly caught fire and by late 2013, the stock was off to the races.

Zuckerberg’s success in pivoting to mobile gives Dollarhide confidence that Meta can cash in on its bet-the-farm move to the metaverse. In the second quarter, Meta’s Reality Labs division, which houses its virtual reality headsets and related technologies, generated $452 million in revenue, about 1.5% of total Meta sales, and [lost $2.8 billion](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/27/meta-reality-labs-lost-2point8-billion-in-q2-2022.html#:~:text=Meta%20lost%20%242.8%20billion%20on%20its%20virtual%20reality%20ambitions%20during%20Q2,-Published%20Wed%2C%20Jul&amp;text=Facebook%20parent%20Meta%20lost%20%242.8,the%20quarter%20ending%20in%20June.).

“I think Zuckerberg is very bright and very ambitious,” said Dollarhide. “I wouldn’t bet against Zuckerberg just like I wouldn’t bet against [Elon Musk](https://www.cnbc.com/elon-musk/).”

Dollarhide’s firm hasn’t owned Facebook shares, though, since 2014, preferring the trajectory of tech companies such as Apple and [Amazon](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AMZN), two of his top holdings.

“The reality is they can be perceived as a value company and not a growth company,” Dollarhide said, regarding Meta.

No matter what happens in the next year or two or even three, Zuckerberg has made clear that the future of the company is in the metaverse, where he’s banking on new businesses forming around virtual reality.

Zhao, from University of Chicago, says there’s immense uncertainty surrounding the metaverse’s prospects.

“The real question is — are daily users ready for the metaverse yet?” Zhao said. “Is the underlying technology ready and mature enough to make that transition seamless? That’s a real question and that may not be all up to Facebook or Meta at this point.”

If Zuckerberg is right, perhaps 10 years from now Meta’s stock price from the depths of 2022 will look like the discount of the decade. And if that happens, predictions of a death spiral will be mocked like a 2012 [cover story from Barron’s](https://ritholtz.com/2012/09/barrons-covers-story-facebook-worth-15/), headlined “Facebook is worth $15” with a thumb pointing down. Four years later, it was trading near $130.

US sanctions on Chinese semiconductors ‘decapitate’ industry, experts say

Mass resignations of US staff are ‘paralyzing’ Chinese chip industry

The Biden administration’s sweeping new export controls aimed at cutting off China from obtaining chips used in supercomputers has caused the “complete collapse” of the Communist country’s semiconductor industry, according to one expert.

“This is what annihilation looks like: China’s semiconductor manufacturing industry was reduced to zero overnight,” Lidang, CEO of Hedgehog Lab, said in a Twitter thread.

Rules announced by the US Department of Commerce last week restricting “US persons” from involvement in manufacturing chips in China had led to mass resignations of American executives from Chinese firms.

Lidang said this had the effect of “paralyzing Chinese manufacturing overnight”, and that the industry was in “complete collapse” with “no chance of survival”.

The rules which came into effect on 12 October would bring severe damage to “Chinese national security as a whole”, Lidang said.

“This is nothing like the 10+ rounds of performative sanctioning during the Trump years — this is a serious act of industry-wide decapitation.”

The US Commerce Department said in a statement announcing the new controls that they were in response to China using supercomputers and semiconductors to create weapons of mass destruction and commit human rights abuses.

“The threat environment is always changing, and we are updating our policies today to make sure we’re addressing the challenges posed by (China) while we continue our outreach and coordination with allies and partners,” Under Secretary of Commerce for Industry and Security Alan Estevez said in a statement.

Semiconductors are used in everything from cars to refrigerators, and are increasingly important in artificial intelligence and advanced military programmes.

Among the new measures were requirements for companies to have licenses to export high-performance chips used in artificial intelligence and supercomputers, and restrict US companies from exporting machinery used in manufacturing chips to China.

Any companies that violated the sanctions could face arrest by the US Department of Justice.

The Chinese government hit back on Thursday, accusing Washington of “Cold War thinking” and appealed for efforts to repair strained relations.

Experts said the new controls on represented a significant escalation in tensions between Beijing and Washington.

“With the latest action, the chasm between the US and China has now expanded to the point of no return,” Abishur Prakash, co-founder of the Center for Innovating the Future, told CNBC.

In August, Mr Biden signed the Chips and Science Act into law which pledged $52bn to revitalise semiconductor manufacturing in the US.

The bipartisan legislation was seen as essential to national security interests to reduce the dependence of Taiwanese-made chips, which account for around 90 per cent of the market.

Earlier this month, Micron announced plans to open a $100bn chip manufacturing plant in Syracuse, New York, bringing 50,000 jobs.

AAPL,There's more to index funds and stocks than VTI and AAPL. Welcome to the world of small cap value stocks.,270,54,1666368988,"An investor invested in 100% equities is often told to consider adding a bond allocation, especially if they admit to being a little risk averse. But what about the investor who desires risk? What are their options besides speculative individual stocks and, well, 'options'? Something more diversified?

The answer is to tilt a special class of stocks empirically shown to outperform its peers: small cap value. [Reminder: value here means 'cheap', measured by price relative to book value.]

This post will collect some data points and qualitative arguments in favor of including a allocation to SCV in your portfolio beyond that of a total stock market index fund.

**How do Small Cap Stocks (growth or value) Perform After Recessions**

[In this figure](https://i.imgur.com/CldTE7l.png), we look at the average return among the 25 *worst* monthly or quarterly periods for small caps. We see on average a 23% decline in the trailing month, followed by average annualized outperformance of 6-8% *above* the large cap stocks, which already average 5-8% annualized returns over the next decade. [Source](https://www.osam.com/Commentary/a-historic-opportunity-in-small-cap)

From another [source](https://www.janushenderson.com/en-us/advisor/article/considering-small-caps-in-an-economic-slowdown/):

> As the data in  the chart below show, small caps (as represented by the Russell 2000® Index) led both large caps (S&P 500®) and mid caps (Russell Mid Cap®) following the last six recessions, returning over 31% on average the following year. At the same time, small-cap returns during those recessions averaged a relatively resilient return of roughly -4%.


But even outside of recessions, the outperformance is [robust across many decades](https://i.imgur.com/W0sAt4K.png), though. [Another graph](https://i.imgur.com/0OaFiH1.png),  and [another](https://i.imgur.com/HBkJ6aA.png).

**Why target cheaper stocks (value, not growth) ?**

 Here are the excess returns (annualized over 1964-2017) of small cap stocks sorted by the cheapness: [figure](https://i.imgur.com/f4lHHSk.png). The cheapest stocks are on the left. [Source](https://www.osam.com/Commentary/a-historic-opportunity-in-small-cap)

This has been validated in the literature, for example by the AQR paper [""Size Matters, If You Control Your Junk""](https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Research/Working-Paper/Size-Matters-If-You-Control-Your-Junk). Essentially, small cap stocks contain a lot of 'junk,' especially among the small cap growth class. [Note: By growth, we use the academic definition of high price / (book value).]

Thus, I would not recommend targeting small cap growth in particular. Growth really just means expensive, and what the data shows is targeting cheaper stocks (value) and applying quality filters like profitability requirements yields better returns.

**Why target small cap value now or in the near future?**

- US small cap value is relatively insulated from the broader global economy, unlike the enormous multinational firms dominating the S&P 500. They do not face the currency risks that are currently hitting large cap company's revenues. [Source](https://www.federatedinvestors.com/insights/article/why-small-cap-value-now.do) and [source](https://www.royceinvest.com/insights/small-cap-interview).

> Value stocks look like a heck of a value right now! Look at it this way. As of yesterday, value stocks have a forward P/E of 13.4, against growth stocks at 22.4. The ratio is 0.57. To get back to the historical average ratio of 0.75, and assuming stable earnings, value stocks would have to rise by about 30 per cent, or growth stocks would have to fall by over 20 per cent, or some combination of both. A little mean reversion here would mean a lot of outperformance for value.

> 
> While it is true that earnings of large growth stocks have grown faster than earnings of small-cap value stocks — Avantis estimated that large growth earnings grew by approximately 194 percent between January 2010 and July 2021 versus an earnings increase of 177 percent for small value stocks — the differential was less than 2 percent per year. That differential is a lot smaller than what would have been the expected differential, and certainly cannot explain the fact that the return to large growth stocks was 492 percent versus the 181 percent return to small value stocks over that same period.

Goldman Sachs analyst:

>  Meanwhile, small cap stocks trade at much more attractive valuation levels than large-caps, according to the note. The S&P SmallCap 600 trades at a P/E multiple of 11x, which is near its cheapest level of the last 30 years. ""This multiple also represents a 30% discount to the S&P 500,"" Kostin said.  That's the largest discount since the dot-com bubble, and if earnings don't deteriorate meaningfully from here, it could represent a big opportunity for investors.

**Cheapness is even more pronounced in Europe**


> Arnold also writes “value stocks in Europe are currently trading on lower PEs than they were five years ago . . . there are very few, if any, parts of developed market equities that the market is so pessimistic about that they’ve actually de-rated over the last five years.”

> On top of the gap between the valuation of European growth and value, there is the gap between US value and European value: “The Russell 1000 value index is a 16.5 forward PE, while the equivalent in Europe is on 11, an enormous differential in its own right. A cheap stock in the US is held in much higher regard than a cheap stock in Europe. Value stocks in Europe are the unloved of the unloved!”
> 
> Finally, Arnold writes that “over the last five years Europe’s cheapest companies have delivered more profit growth than their growth counterparts so over that 5 year period the real growth stocks in Europe, in terms of fundamentals anyway, have been the value stocks!”

**It's a good hedge if there is a decade stagnation of the broader markets**

>  After Japan's bubble burst, from 1990 to 2019, Japanese total country returns averaged 0.6%. Japanese small cap value averaged 5.13% and Japanese value stocks averaged 4%. During 2000-2010,  US small cap value grew 7.94% on average and US value stocks grew 4.56% on average, in contrast to a declining/flat S&P 500. 


Source: Ben Felix's various videos on small cap value.

You aren't just tilting a riskier asset class, you're tilting something that is less correlated to the broader market than your typical stock holdings. Hedge yourselves against a lost decade with this asset class.

**But why add if VTI already has small cap value inside it?**

Because market weights aren't gospel, and just as someone with less risk tolerance adds bonds, someone with more can add small cap value. VTI places 3% of its allocation into the SCV category. How about make it 10%?

**Ticker recommendations**:

I use AVUV/AVDV personally for US small cap value and ex-US developed small cap value. Some people also use VIOV or VBR. You could of course pick your own stocks, but the risk is definitely amplified.

I explain [in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/xrwvxu/rstocks_daily_discussion_fundamentals_friday_sep/iqjujjw/) how Avantis (who created AVUV and AVDV) approach their ETFs. They already use quality filters to make sure you avoid junk while still getting a diversified exposure. 

> They look at profitability (measured by profits/book equity) as well as valuation (price/book equity). They also account for bias from 'goodwill,' which pushes up book equity after mergers/acquisitions. This way, you target companies that organically grow. They also target companies with low investment rates, because it turns out that small cap growth companies ""tend to raise capital when their discount rates are low (meaning
their prices are high relative to fundamentals) causing subsequent
underperformance."" And they tend to give weight to momentum, because you shouldn't just throw out a company from an index because it is doing *too* well.  Thus, you get a diversified (>600 companies in AVUV) exposure to some of the cheapest, small cap companies out there, that are highly profitable, organically growing, invest conservatively, and (may) have positive momentum. In contrast, the S&P 500 is highly dominated by a few enormously sized companies that engage in large amounts of acquisitions. Not that that's a bad thing.

AAPL,Apple today is a good example why the markets are so hard.,1859,400,1666981859,"Whenever there's a large upside or downside move in the markets, everyone's thoughts are, ""Why did the markets go up/down today?""

And there are a myriad of reasons why. But at the end of the day, the simplest and truest answer is, ""Because there were more buyers than sellers"" (or vice versa).

Apple's earnings yesterday was definitely a sigh of relief for investors, cinching a much needed win in this week of big-tech earnings misses.

However, does it deserve a ~8% upside move in a single day? I don't know, but that's a $200 billion move in market cap, larger than any company outside of the top 50 largest companies globally. Don't quote me on this, but I think this is probably the biggest percentage day gain for $AAPL in more than 10 years. Interesting.

Some folks think the move was exacerbated by today being EOY for mutual funds, so maybe there's a large one-sided buying skew from big fund positioning. Other folks think that it's just another day of a gamma-squeeze with 0 DTE calls being hammered all day long. Maybe the earnings was really THAT good in the grand scheme of big tech earnings misses this quarter. At the end of the day, trying to find rhyme or reason for moves on a single day basis will drive you mad. Trying to find rhyme or reason for moves on a weekly basis will also drive you mad.

With all that being said, what's peculiar about this situation is that $AAPL now is the most expensive it's ever been relative to the NASDAQ 100. While trying to find reasons for moves in markets is impossible, what is understandable is the ebb and flow of markets during a bear market. Similarly to the dot-com bubble, you had the trashiest stocks implode many months before the rest of the market tanked. Before full capitulation happened, there was a flight to safety in big-cap tech stocks as well. In bear markets like these, it's human nature to preserve what you have and ""fly"" to safety. Apple is the safety net everyone is flocking to, and I believe it will be painful.

Full disclaimer, I've been bearish all year, but bullish over the past couple weeks. Earlier this week I actually thought THE bottom might be in for markets, and the worst had probably come. But today's move in $AAPL has changed my view and I now believe there is still one last shoe to drop soon in the markets.

There is currently a bubble in ""safe"" value large-cap stocks, and I believe this cohort will drive the overall market lower over the next few months. Apple is the ring-leader, but there are several others that at interesting valuations. (I personally think buying beaten-down growth tech is much more attractive than these). Altria ($MO) 47 P/E, Clorox ($CLX) 38 P/E, Kraft Heinz ($KHC) 38 P/E, Colgate-Palmolive ($CL) 32 P/E, Hershey ($HSY) 30 P/E, PepsiCo ($PEP) 26 P/E. These are brands we all know, and they are trading at eye-watering levels, driven by a ""flight to safety"" by big funds who have no choice during this year's turmoil.

I think the moves in these ""value"" stocks can be attributed to a single philosophy that I've heard from folks who were fund managers in a different generation. ""You won't be fired for buying IBM"". Underperforming the benchmark because you invested in risky stocks like $CVNA and $W? Fired. Underperforming the benchmark because you invested in quality stocks like $CLX and $PEP?

TSLA,Elon Musk tells Twitter staff he sold Tesla stock to save the social network,3039,624,1668136285," 

Twitter's new owner Elon Musk, who is also CEO of electric vehicle maker [Tesla](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TSLA/) and U.S. defense contractor SpaceX, told employees of the social media business on Thursday that he recently sold shares of Tesla to ""save Twitter.""

He made the remarks during an all-hands meeting that he hosted in part to motivate Twitter employees who remain after sweeping layoffs to work hard. Musk let go of about half of Twitter employees following his acquisition of the company for $44 billion, or $54.20 per share.

[As CNBC previously reported,](https://www.cnbc.com/elon-musk/) to finance his portion of that take-private deal, last week Musk sold at least another $3.95 billion worth of [Tesla](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TSLA/) stock. According to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission published Tuesday, the batch of shares he just sold amounted to 19.5 million more shares of Tesla.

Earlier this year, he also sold over $8 billion worth of Tesla stock in April and roughly $7 billion worth in August.

Musk has [brought in employees from Tesla](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/31/elon-musk-has-pulled-more-than-50-tesla-engineers-into-twitter.html), including dozens of Autopilot engineers, to help with code review and other work at Twitter along with friends, financial backers and deputies from other companies that he has co-founded.

Musk’s Twitter distraction has shaken some of Tesla’s most stalwart bulls.

TSLA,"10 Tesla Investors Lose $132.5 Billion From Musk's Twitter Fiasco. Interestingly, Musk sold $3.5 billion in tsla stock from 12-14.",322,127,1671120995," 

**Tesla** ([**TSLA**](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA)) investors are growing tired of Elon Musk's Twitter fiasco. And for good reason.

The 10 largest investors in the electric-vehicle maker's stock, including ETF giants Vanguard, **BlackRock** ([**BLK**](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=BLK)) and [**Musk himself**](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/etfs/elon-musk-sp500-lost-this-staggering-amount-on-tesla-stock/), lost nearly $133 billion since Twitter's board accepted Musk's buyout on April 25, says an Investor's Business Daily analysis of data from S&P Global Market Intelligence and [**MarketSmith**](https://marketsmith.investors.com/?src=A012BF).

It cost Musk the position as the richest person in the world. But he's not alone feeling the pain.

## Tesla Stock Dropping Like A Rock

Tesla's value is down more than 52% since the Twitter buyout was approved on April 25, while the S&P 500 is only off 5.5%. And Tesla stock is off 29% since the deal closed on Oct. 27, much worse than the S&P 500's 6.6% gain in that time. Shares are down again Wednesday, by 3.4% to 155.38.

That's shredding a jaw-dropping amount of wealth for Tesla investors. The value of Tesla is down $339 billion from the Twitter deal's approval and $206 billion from the close.

Investors worry that Musk is so infatuated with Twitter, he's not minding Tesla.

Investors owning shares of Tesla, now down more than 50% this year, are vocally expressing displeasure. ""There is no TSLA CEO today,"" Gary Black, managing partner of the Future Fund, which is down nearly $18 million on its Tesla stock since April, tweeted Monday, as [**first reported by the Wall Street Journal**](https://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-investors-voice-concern-over-elon-musks-focus-on-twitter-11670948786?mod=hp_lead_pos7).

## It's Not Just Costing Elon Musk

Musk is definitely [**suffering the most from the Tesla implosion**](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/tesla-stock-burned-as-musk-goes-ballistic-on-twitter/). As the largest shareholder with 14.1% of the company, he's personally lost $47.9 billion from the time the Twitter deal closed.

But losses are spreading to Main Street, too, as the giant ETF and mutual fund companies are the next biggest owners. Vanguard, which is [**forecasting a recession**](https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/sectors/sp500-vanguard-predicts-global-recession-next-year-why-to-believe/) next year, is the No. 2 largest holder of Tesla stock. It owns nearly 7% of the company. And due to that, its shareholders are down nearly $23 billion from the Twitter deal close.

What will Musk's infatuation with Twitter ultimately cost Tesla investors?

TSLA,It's too much of a risk to not own TSLA.,0,193,1671572424,"Let's do some math. 

Given Shanghai's current run rate is 22k per week, that annualizes to a little of 1M per year. Fremont does 600k a year, and I'm estimating Berlin and Austin both do about \~300k next year(Run rate of 75k per quarter at Q1 and then run rate of 500k at end of Q3. That means give or take 300k total). This adds up to 2.2M next year in line with their own 50% yoy growth estimates. 

Kell Blue Book also has the avg selling price of a Tesla in November of 2022 to be 68K. Apparently were supposed to have a recession next year, so let's say Tesla is forced to lower the avg selling price of their vehicle down to 59k. 

This would give Tesla about 130B in revenue next year (2.2M \* 59k). Assuming operating margins of 20%, this leaves Tesla with 26B in profit. Divide 26B by the number of shares outstanding, 3.468B, and you get an eps of $7.5. 

What does that make Tesla's forward PE ratio you might ask? Less than Apples. With a share price of $140, Tesla has a forward PE of 18.7. Apple has a forward PE ratio of 19.55.

TSLA,Parted with TSLA this week after holding for 5 years. Here's why.,1964,381,1671850615,"Been a TSLA investor since 2017. This week I made the decision to pull out of the company (over 1,500 shares). After being up 800%+ at one point, I left after it came crashing back down to ~180%. I did not incur a loss, I am just not walking away with retirement levels of money that I could have possibly walked away with a mere year ago. Dumb? Maybe. Did I need to sell? No. Does it give me peace? Absolutely.

Being a TSLA investor was interesting. Elon has always been Elon and I believe the company is indeed positioned for long-term growth (even now). There were plenty of ups and downs, but I never 'doubted my vibe' and the Elon antics up until the latter half of 2022 I would have described almost as eccentric. The guy was an idiot from time to time, but was definitely doing something right. Tesla is competitive, innovative, and is a leader in the EV space. Long-term, the company has a ton of upward potential. Emphasis on the word 'potential.' 

However, there has been a change. Things with Elon have certainly become more radical and it seems that every single day there is a new headline that is slowly destroying the brand. Now, before we get into the whole ""but Elon isn't Tesla!"" let me tell you the incredible importance of consumer sentiment and branding. 

I do not imagine Tesla ever being divorced from Elon Musk. When you think ""Tesla"" you cannot escape thinking ""Elon Musk."" It is like trying to think about Microsoft without thinking or mentioning Bill Gates or some other strong brand-to-noun association. Go ahead and do yourself a favor and search Tesla now and see what comes up. Headline after headline is about Musk. This is not good for the brand, especially considering their consumer segment is actively being isolated. 

Now, one must ask: why do people buy things? There's a wide array of reasons, but I believe fundamentally it boils down to the value and reputation of the product. The value has a mix of factors that range from price, functionality, importance, etc. and reputation can be understood as how the brand is perceived, how the consumer is perceived as a result of owning the product, and how the consumer feels owning the product. This is where I lose the belief in the growth potential despite the positioning. Simply put, I do not think consumers are going to feel good about buying a Tesla with the negativity surrounding Elon. 

A mere year ago, if a person bought a Tesla or owned a Tesla, what would this say about a person? How would that person feel about that purchase? Tesla was the cool, sophisticated brand that was essentially symbolic of changing the world. Just look at Tesla's mission statement: ""Tesla's mission is to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy through increasingly affordable electric vehicles in addition to renewable energy generation and storage. Tesla is accelerating the world's transition to sustainable energy."" 

Where is this brand now? How would a person feel now? Ask yourself, if someone pulled up in a Tesla what would you think about them? What feelings would it invoke?

Often times, we want to distance ourselves from feelings and sentiment and put an enormous emphasis on reason, facts, and data. This is not necessarily wrong, but this is certainly also not unique to the financial realm and TSLA has a history of this as well. We had people putting in orders for vehicles that were not being produced, people YOLOing their life savings into the stock because they believed in the future growth of the company before the company was seriously competitive, an unprecedented cult-like following that boosted the stock and gave the company an incredible amount of capital, and so on. Yet, when we look at TSLA now and think about the projected growth, why think people will actually want to continue to buy this product? Who is going to spend the money of a luxury vehicle to suddenly be associated with a person that people are increasingly viewing in a negative way? Not me. Apparently not my friends or co-workers either who were previously considering a Tesla and now want nothing to do with it. And apparently not my friend who is a Tesla owner and is starting to feel embarrassed for driving one. We can talk about how ""dumb"" these people are, but we cannot escape these are legitimate and valid sentiments toward the brand that have real costs associated with them.  

The sentiment cannot be captured in a graph right now. You have no data points on the would-be consumers because they are now never-were consumers. This data is only going to show in their sales. If sales continue to go up, then it seems reasonable to say that consumer sentiment has not reached a level where people feel so negatively about the product that they stopped buying. What I am suggesting here is that it my belief that this will inevitably happen because of the intimate link between Tesla and Elon. Tesla could get a new CEO, change leadership, etc., but I do not see them escaping this link and I believe it will ultimately be the detriment to the brand. Sales will not completely stop, but the growth projections that the stock relied heavily on I believe will certainly slow a lot sooner than shareholders anticipated and if it ever does reach previous target prices of $250+, this will not be for a long time. 

I'm not bullish or bearish on the stock. I do not think the company is going to suddenly vanish and the stock will drop to <$50 (at least I hope not for many of the investors I know). However, I also do not think the growth will be as aggressive as it once could have been and this is going to limit the stock in many ways. If we factor in slowed growth from the recession, one must keep in mind that this is just more time for Elon to further damage the brand between now and when people are in better buying conditions. What's next? Apparently removing Twitter's suicide prevention feature. Maybe tomorrow it's denying climate change and next month will be another stock sell off after yet another promise of not doing so. Though, ultimately, this is no longer my problem. The integrity of my financial future is no longer jeopardized by a guy that is becoming increasingly unhinged without the board properly exercising their duty to act in the interest of shareholders.

o ELI5 the company’s business model

§ Tesla primarily designs, develops and manufactures fully electronic vehicles and has a smaller solar generation and battery storage business. They are currently investing into self-driving vehicles and humanoid robots.

· **Company Soundness**

o How does the company collect revenue? Does the company have a good or services that is purchased frequently or a regular interval?

§ Tesla sells their products Direct to consumer. Their cars and solar options are purchased directly on their website. Most of the products they sell are durable goods. That is to say they are high ticket items that are often purchased once and without a frequent and recurring interval. Having said that, since Tesla is vertically integrated, they also have the potential to grow a larger service revenue stream for their products.

o Do they operate with significant leverage?

§ Very little. Tesla uses a meager $0.14 of debt for every $1 of equity on their balance sheet. This compares with 3.08 to 1 at Ford 1.76 to 1 at GM. Consequently, they have an extremely high 56x interest coverage ratio.

o Is their balance sheet will suited for a downturn and why?

§ Yes, between the low debt and significant cash cushion they are well cushioned. This is evidenced by $19.5 billion in cash, $2.41 billion in unused credit lines. Additionally, Tesla is cash flow positive with the widest cash flow margins in the industry. Tesla expects Capex to be 6-8 billion over next two years. Management reported on their September 22 10-Q that they believe they have sufficient capital to fund their growth plans.

§ They do have $983 million of debt due in the next 12 months which is easily covered from their cash stash or through a refinance and extension of maturity.

· **Can it be Replicated?**

o Is there evidence that the company has defended its market position in the past?

§ None. Tesla is a new company and electric vehicles within transportation is a new industry. Having said that, history of the auto industry suggests high barriers. You have a business with large, fixed costs, a cyclical product and need some level of scale to allow customers to believe they can get it serviced.

§ Additionally, like capitalism often does, high returns attract new capital and bring about lower returns. The flight of capital has been seen; the question is will new players be able to make enduring franchises in a historically tough market?

o Is there evidence that market power is growing and that this will lead to strong financials?

§ Yes. Tesla now has enough scale to rival legacy auto manufacturers. They crush Ford and GM in virtually every financial metric. (TSLA, F, GM is the order of the following)

§ Gross Margin: 26.6%, 11.4%,13.6%

§ ROA: 17%, 3.5%, 3.8%

§ FCF margin: 11.9%, 1.7%, 0.8%

o What is the competitive advantage?

§ In my view, they have two advantages at this point: low-cost provider and Intangible assets

§ Low-Cost Provider:

· Relative to legacy players, Tesla has a lower cost operating model. For example, by selling 100% of their cars DTC they can sell them at retail prices to consumer whereas legacy auto sells their cars to dealers at wholesale prices. During a recessionary period, this will serve to benefit Tesla. As customers defer purchases of cars, prices will typically fold (this has started to occur with the most recent series of inflation reports) When you have 22% gross margins and 12% FCF margins, you can drop prices far lower and be profitable than when your competitors are at \~12% gross margins and \~1% free cash flow margins.

· It appears that this advantage is not done being flexed. Even with a lower overall volume of cars being sold combined with a significantly higher growth rate, Tesla’s revenue/employee continues to soar. Currently it is about the same as Ford and GM. I would expect in future years with additional growth, Tesla will surpass them.

§ Intangibles

· As a brand, Tesla is the undisputed leader in EVs. Having said that, Elon’s moves into twitter and more importantly politics of late have caused some people to put their nose up at Tesla. I personally feel this will be a passing thing, particularly as Elon has announced his intent to step down as CEO of twitter, although that does not mean he will stop tweeting. Despite this headwind, Elon and Tesla have been able to grow the brand through fanfare and organic attention rather than spending blocks of marketing dollars.

· Vertical integration. Tesla owns production and the service center network. This has allowed them to offer far better services. Currently, when your Tesla is in the shop, they attempt to give all customers fully loaded up-to-date versions of their current car to get them to salivate for an upgrade. They also make house calls and are sometimes able to repair your car in your driveway. Additionally, by vertically integrating the design and production process, they own the IP for the core components of the EVs. This gives them another cost advantage. They put the core components of their cars in at cost, other players put them in at a markup from their suppliers.

· First mover advantage. Tesla has outfitted with what they believe to be the necessary equipment for self-driving technology since October of 2016. This allowed them to have customers subsidize the cost by buying the car and gave them more data than any other company to develop this highly complicated technology. They also have a large charging network. Admittedly this benefit will likely lessen as the charging network infrastructure matures.

· Legacy costs. As in Tesla has none of them, whereas legacy auto has all the transition issues. Imagine trying to be Ford or GM and you know the future is EVs. What do you do with your unionize gas engineers? Will a layoff cause a strike? You know that selling through dealers puts you at a cost disadvantage, how do you cut them out of the deal? States have regulations that don’t allow dealers and manufactures to be owned by the same entity. How do you cut out dealers for sales but keep them for service? How do you solve the above issues while also maintaining profitability because you are heavily indebted in a fairly high interest rate environment? These aren’t so much strengths of Tesla, but are weaknesses of legacy auto.

· It is really hard to put into words all the changes Tesla has made. For example, they sell cars on their website without a model year advertised. This small but subtle change should help deal with the seasonality affect of ordering. Additionally, they have been able to add differentiated features to the car that nobody else has done before causing viral free advertising just for being cool. Ludicrous mode with the Spaceballs animation, verbal commands like “open your butthole” to access the charging port. It’s a joke, I get it, but it creates real buzz and interest.

o Would $10 billion of capital be enough to re-create the company?

§ No, you would likely need far more. As of now, $26 billion has been put into to Rivian and expects to produce 25,000 cars this year. As I mentioned earlier, the lack of new brands or the ability for players to scale up in the auto industry for such a long period of time is suggestive of the very real barriers. With higher rates and a recession looming, capital may be more difficult to come by for smaller less established players.

o Are parts of the company not able to be recreated with capital? Which parts and why?

§ To be honest, much of the company could be replicated with capital. The big thing, is there are really no other major players who have been able to do it anywhere near as close to the scale with the financial success as Tesla.

o Are there competitive threats on the horizon?

§ Several. This is a big industry going through a significant change. When these things happen, that attracts a significant amount of capital and competition. Every major auto company is investing into EVs, new entrants are entering the space and even large competitors like Apple are looking to enter.

· **Growth**

o Is there a 90% chance that earnings will be up 5 years from now?

§ Yes, Tesla is still a relatively small player in the auto space and has great trends with past growth and future expectations.

o Is there a 50% chance earnings will continue to grow in excess of 7% per year after the 5 year period?

§ Yes, they have a long pipeline ahead of them and have investments that offer many call options on their business.

· **Watch List Decision**

o Do you honestly know enough about the industry and company to make an investment decision?

§ Kind of. Tesla is extremely complicated, operating in new industries with new technology. Its hard to say with confidence that I have a solid understanding of the factors given the increasing rate of change with energy production and auto.

o Bottom Line: Based on your answers is the company well insulated from economic and competitive shocks while able to grow for many years to come?

§ Given the competitive strengths combined with the many weaknesses of the legacy operators I feel there is a real chance to cement an advantage in this rapidly evolving space.

§ It is also worth pointing out that long term, I feel the auto industry will go on to have similar economics of the aerospace industry. In the highly regulated aerospace industry, engines are often sold at breakeven or even a loss but come with highly lucrative 20-year service contracts making for high margin recurring revenue which gives these companies much of their value. While it is unlikely that auto will get as regulated as aerospace, I do think that the car itself over time will be more and more commoditized. The breadcrumbs for this are there. Tesla could have franchised service centers to grow with far less capex, but they didn’t. Tesla could have avoided the auto insurance like every other car company, but they are pursuing it. Obviously, the holy grail in the industry is self-driving. Conquering that gives an obvious service revenue stream for customers who purchase this add-on. Additionally, they can collect transportation fees on a robo-taxi network. Self-driving and the data from it obviously gives them a leg up on legacy insurance companies in evaluating the risk of their drivers.

§ When you put the clear cost advantage with the breadcrumbs to build the future, I think it is fair to say that Tesla earns a well deserved spot on a watch list.

· **Valuation**

o Value the company

§ Ha! Difficult, very difficult!

§ 2022 Rev Expectations: $83.075 billion

§ 2025 Rev Expectations: $167.5 Billion (26% CAGR)

§ 2028 rev Expectations: $315.7 Billion (23.5% CAGR from ’25 to ’28)

§ Shares outstanding as of 10/18/22 were 3,157,752,449

§ Over the past 6 months shares have increased at an annual rate of \~2.0%

§ Over the past 3 years they have increased at an annual rate of \~5.4%

§ Elon has discussed, but not started a buyback. Given their additional scale, and sufficient capital, I think it is prudent to project a lesser share count increase going forward. I will assume a 1% to 4% increase in shares.

§ This implies shares outstanding of 3.253 billion to 3.552 billion 3 years from now.

§ Since scale had been achieved, FCF margins have increased steadily to 11.9%. While a recession is likely to lower margins, long term additional service revenues and scale could easily raise them. I think a midpoint expectation of 14% with a range of 7% to 21% is probably fair.

§ To model a bear scenario I assumed a 25% reduction in revenue for the 2025 target to model effects from a recession and slower rollout of self-driving. For a bull case I assumed a 10% premium to the revenue target to assume better adoption. This gives us a revenue range $127.5 billion and $187.1 billion for ’25.

§ At a 7% FCF margin with 3.552 billion shares outstanding on revenue of $125.6 billion we get FCF per share of $2.46 in our bear case. With a 21% FCF margin on $184.2 billion of revenue with 3.253 billion shares we get a bullish FCF per share of 11.88.

§ With growth expectations in 2028 slowing but still high overall, I will assume a FCF yield between 2.5% to 5% for 2025.

§ When you put it all together you get an estimated value in 2025 of $98 to $237 per share for a mid-point of $168.05

§ With a current price of $123, this implies an annual return of 12% per year at the midpoint from these levels. The bull case implies a 25% CAGR and the bear case implies a loss of 6% per year.

o Would it be a prudent investment to buy the company at current levels?

§ For me, I feel that given the uncertainty in the future of the industry and company overall I would want to earn a 15% per year on an investment on Tesla. Currently, my estimates suggest a 12% rate of return. To potentially earn 15%, Tesla would need to be purchased for a price less than $112. This leaves it marginally overvalued. It really boils down to what it always does, if you believe they will execute on the vision that has been laid out. If that is the case, gains will likely be quite nice from these levels.

TSLA,TSLA - Bull Case (Qualitative Opinion),0,161,1671894355,"A lot of posts about folks dumping Tesla. Here are some counter points. I welcome feedback! Please be civil. 

1.	I sincerely doubt people are shying away from Tesla because of Elon. Even if they are, it is a short term phenomenon because of his involvement in Twitter. Like all stupid forays, this foray will come to an end as well and money will rush back in again. 

2.	Tesla makes great cars. Buyers remorse is almost non existent. People love their cars, flaws and all! There isn’t a car that is anywhere close to it from a technology perspective. (you may debate this - but find me a car that has a greater range + capabilities)

3.	Tesla does not spend a dime on advertising! Just think of the brand awareness and consideration this company has without spending a dime on advertising. Others are spending billions! Even Porsche who I think is the closest competition has billboards all over the place!

4.	They are profitable! This is not a smoke and mirror show. Maybe you say that the autopilot is a joke and not a fully featured solution. The retort would be, how many people are paying for FSD via subscription and what is the cancellation rate? It is near 5%. If Tesla is able to retain 95% of its customer base in something “frivolous” like FSD, surely there is something that FSD is doing correctly. 

5.	Tesla cars are priced where they are because of demand and supply. They are able to presell every car they produce. Obviously, the recession may cause some havoc and reduce demand in the short term. How will Tesla weather this? Based on the moves they are making, it feels like they are taking an active approach to managing staff, expenses and ultimately production. The drop in stock price is because of this! This is the uncertainty that is causing the institutional investors to reduce their positions. 

6.	Tesla has experienced meteoric growth and with the growth comes “fat” (ask any body builder). The “recession” is the perfect back drop for Tesla to become lean and hungry again. Think about the GE in its hey day and the 10% rule!

7.	Tesla is more than a car company”. This is a polarizing statement! But let’s look at the evidence to see where on the spectrum they lie. A) Do they have technology that goes above and beyond transportation (Yes, Solar, Commercial Energy, Insurance, SaaS). So, objectively, I would say more true than not. Given this, valueing it as such is the right thing to do. 

8.	They are vertically integrated, their reliance on partners decreases day by day! This is the Apple model and why Apple’s consumer experience is head and shoulders above everyone else. Tesla controls almost all aspects of its production. Tesla does not even use dealerships to sell their cars! The full control allows them to be nimble and take decisions that are consumer centric!

9.	Important point: For the last 10 years they have navigated the business extremely well! I have to give them an A for execution. Every challenge has been met with bold strategy and then executed to critical success. The team is the same, so why should the results be any different 10 years from now? Elon is one man and sure he may have brain fart from now and then, but the team and culture (results oriented) he has developed for the last 10 years will be the difference maker!

10. Just like how Steve Jobs was succeeded by Tim Cook, innovative companies like Tesla will always attract the best and brightest. I’m confident that even in the absence of Elon, there will be a competent leader who take the reins and extract greatness. 

11. I’m not going to call Elon a genius yet. But he is operating at much higher scale when compared to everyone else. Setting aside his success with PayPal. To gestate Tesla and at the same time expand into solar & rockets and compete successfully should show you that the man is not normal. And with this, you should expect some level of eccentricity. If not for this eccentricity (his downfall) he would likely rule the world. Be glad that Twitter is the channel for his eccentricities vs Tesla. 

Again, these are all the musings of a random fool that is me. I have an investment in Tesla and am adding to my position slowly but surely. The thesis behind my investment has not changed and there is nothing yet that gives me worry (yet).",0.47,0,0.224803269,0.112401634,24-12-2022 15:05,130.4878235,85.25,89.58998108,234.8754425,123.1500015

AMZN,Amazon(AMZN) DCF Analysis need criticisms and advice,75,39,1673143102,"# HISTORY:

The story of AMZN is one of trials and tribulation, it was not always smooth sailing where valuation steadily rose over the years. Rather, it was one that required a visionary CEO, one who had sufficient foresight to take gambles that paid off, one who could stomach the choppy seas of business cycles, one who had the determination and patience to see through their largest gambles. Having a humble beginning, AMZN’s IPO MC was valued at $430 Million before losing 95% of their valuation in the tech bubble crash. AMZN managed to survive the tech bubble crash but their valuation held rather steady at around 17 billion in the early 2000s. Meaning investors believed that AMZN could no longer grow past this threshold and have matured. Reaching 17 billion in valuation by itself would’ve been an impressive feat but it wouldn’t be enough for a story worthy for the history books as companies like WMT had a valuation of about 200 billion at the same point in time. AMZN released prime in 2005, their X factor to differentiate themselves from their competitor. Net income was 588 million that year but due to large investments into prime net income in 2006 fell to 190 million nearly 67%. Consequently, from 2005 to 2006 AMZN's MC fell nearly 20%  as investors did not fully believe in prime. But Jeff Bezos, believing in his dream for fast shipping, was unfazed by the whole ordeal and carried on investing heavily into the retail business. And this investment paid off as today we know AMZN as the 5th largest company by market cap in the world.

Tl;dr: Jeff Bezos I love you please sponsor my University fees.

# INTRODUCTION:

AMZN business model involves a few revenue sources, in no particular order.

1. Online Retail + Physical Store (AMZN Store): Their online retail website that generates the bulk of revenue, as physical stores have mostly stagnated and occupy a meager amount of revenue I'll combine both Online Retail and Physical Store into AMZN store in my DCF.
2. Amazon Web Services(AWS): Their cloud computing services which helps take businesses big and small into the cloud. Providing servers as well for firms. Brian Olsavsky described AWS as a business that helps firms change their fixed cost into variable cost, meaning firms pay more as they use more.
3. Third Party Services(3P): AMZN has extended their retail transport capabilities to their competitors allowing third party to set up their store on the webpage, leaving the problem of transporting the goods to AMZN.
4. Advertising: The latest significant addition to AMZN's top line, AMZN sold the capability for advertisers to have their products more visible to customers on their retail store and providing tools for advertisers to analyze the data collected.
5. Subscription: Lastly, Amazon Prime. Consisting of Prime video, Prime Gaming and Prime shipping.
6. Others: representing the other businesses that AMZN has tried breaking into like Twitch but for simplicity sake and because Others represented about 0.5% of revenue in 2021 I'll not forecast this in my DCF.

# REVENUE:

**AMZN store**:  
2022, Retail has been hit pretty hard due to inflationary pressures and Ukraine War bumping up costs. Retail has definitely taken a hard beating for 2022. As per 2022 Q3 earnings transcript, ""reduction in fulfilment and transportation capital investment...to better align with demand."" We can expect revenue to have taken a hit and definitely lower than 2021's 22% Y/Y.

Past 2022 however, I expect AMZN store to pick up as there is a large demand for the convenience provided by AMZN.  ""more than 90 percent of consumers expect two- to three-day delivery as the norm, while 30 percent expect same-day delivery."" - [(JPMorgan,1)](https://www.jpmorgan.com/solutions/treasury-payments/insights/why-shopping-has-changed-forever). Only AMZN is well situated in terms of fulfillment center, transportation and capacity for expansion to meet this goal. In fact, AMZN is expected to be the largest e-commerce platform world wide by 2027 [(Statista,2)](https://www.statista.com/statistics/379046/worldwide-retail-e-commerce-sales/) earning about 1.2 Trillion.

AMZN store is likely to have very high growth going into 2023 until at least 2025. It took AMZN about 2 years to double their fulfilment network from 2019 - 2020 hence the negative cash flows back then. So I'm assuming AMZN is going to be an aggressive grower with high revenues and low margins as AMZN will be expanding into new markets it'll probably minimally need to spend another 2 years doubling its current size. Hence I project high growth period from 2023 - 2025.  


**AWS:**  
2022, firms are likely to be more conservative in these uncertain times preferring to have more cash reserves in hand. AWS offers a pay-as-you-go approach, not requiring firms to tie up large capital into AWS and AWS helps business to reduce cost. As per 2022 Q3 earnings transcript, ""we've seen an uptick in AWS customers focused on controlling cost"" All that being said, I don't really expect any crazy amount of growth in AWS as companies are more likely to have their capital tied up in footing the bill for higher labor cost. Even management forecast growth ""more in the mid 20% growth rate"". Compared to 2021's Y/Y at 37.1% so 2022's Y/Y is about 13% lower than 2021's Y/Y growth rate.

AWS is likely to have high growth as well going into 2023 as management announces plans to introduce AWS to more regions ""launch of the AWS middle east region in August and the recent announcement to launch AWS Asia Pacific."" The cloud computing is a whole new realm of endless opportunities for Amazon to capitalize on, with the market expected to grow from 548 billion in 2022 to 1240 billion in 2027, [(marketsandmarkets,3)](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/cloud-computing-market-234.html) AWS being in a good spot at about 38% market share as of Q1 2022, [(statista, 4)](https://www.statista.com/statistics/967365/worldwide-cloud-infrastructure-services-market-share-vendor/) to capitalize on this large market. Similarly I expect high growth period from 2023 - 2025.  


**3P:**  
I was thinking about how exactly should I go about forecasting third party but due to a lack of available data I actually forecast 3P with respect to AMZN store.

Of course this was not just a random guess, 3P has always observed a direct relationship with AMZN store. Taking 3P revenue as a percentage of AMZN store from 2016 - 2021 that number has held steady at  a range of 25% - 43%, it makes logical sense as well for 3P to have a direct relationship with AMZN store as 3P are retailers facing the same economical environment faced by AMZN store.

So throughout my DCF, I took 3P's revenue as 33% of AMZN store, 33% is the average of 25% and 43%.3P undergoes same growth period Y/Y as AMZN store.

&#x200B;

**Subscription:**  
Subscription was treated the same as 3P. My rationale for this was that you have to use AMZN store in order for a subscription to Amazon Prime to be useful for you. At least anecdotally, barring lord of the rings I have not really heard of any memorable titles on Prime Video. In fact, ""Seventy-nine percent of Amazon Prime users cite **free shipping** as the primary reason they subscribe to the service"", [(chainstoreage,5)](https://chainstoreage.com/technology/the-no-1-reason-people-subscribe-to-amazon-prime-is#:~:text=Seventy-nine%20percent%20of%20Amazon,%2C%20Twitch%2C%20or%20other%20benefits).

Subscription from 2016 - 2021 when taken as a percentage of AMZN store held steady at a range of 7% - 13%.

So throughout my DCF, I took Subscription's revenue as 10% of AMZN store, 10% being the average of 7% and 13%. Subscription undergoes same growth period Y/Y as AMZN store.  


**Advertising:**  
2022, I'd expect advertising to fall as the advertising industry has proven to be a cyclical one. Using GOOG as a proxy for example, advertising revenue for GOOG actually decreased Y/Y in Q3 so similar results can be expected for AMZN.

I won't expect very high growth for Advertising however as it is quite limited in terms of what can be advertised as compared to GOOG. For example, GOOG is able to advertise service companies but AMZN may not be able to advertise services on the retail webpage.

Regardless, AMZN is still a strong player in the advertising industry. By 2023, AMZN is expected to earn 7.1% of revenue in the digital advertising market worldwide, [(statistia,6)](https://www.statista.com/statistics/290629/digital-ad-revenue-share-of-major-ad-selling-companies-worldwide/).

I wouldn't expect much high growth for advertising as not much exciting news or technology was introduced for advertising that would significantly increase revenue.  


# EBIT:

As per Q3 2022 earnings transcript, ""drop in operating margin...we're working hard to make sure that current profitability is not the new normal."" Margins have taken a hit in 2022 due to higher labor costs from the tighter labor market and the Ukraine War affecting gas prices which affects energy prices affecting AWS' margins. I'd expect 2022's margins to be smaller than historical margins. The latest 3Y average margin was at 5.47%. Due to AMZN starting to lay off workers on 4th Jan 2023, I'd assume the margins were hit pretty hard, for them to have to further reduce expenses. Margins assumed at 4.5%.

AMZN's margins are not likely to significantly increase from 2023 - 2025 as AMZN is going to continue heavily reinvest back into the company so margins are most likely to go back to the norm of 5.47% by 2025 at the end of the high growth period.

But, as AMZN goes off their high growth period from 2026 onwards, margins are going to increase as they stop focusing on growing their business but start to become mature. I'd assume margins are about 9% by the end of my forecast period in 2031.  


# ASSUMPTIONS:

1. Taxes are taken to be 20%, 2021's tax rate was 19.26% so I'd assume in this similar conditions as closely as possible taxes are about 20%.
2. D&A taken to be 7% with respect to revenue, historically from 2016 - 2021 D&A with respect to revenue on average was 7%.
3. Other Ops Exp/Inc and Deferred income tax was omitted from being forecasted despite appearing on the cash flow statement as they were too meager so I opted for less granularity and omitted them.
4. Change in NWC taken to be -0.5% with respect to revenue, historically from 2016 - 2021 the average was -0.5%
5. CapEX assumed to be 11% for the high growth period from 2022 - 2025. Before decreasing to reflect a maturing company. A picture of CapEX and D&A side by side: [https://imgur.com/qfOJPNF](https://imgur.com/qfOJPNF)   
positive net asset balance was taken throughout forecast period.
6. TGR taken to be 2%.
7. WACC is taken at 9.2%, Calculations is as such.

# QUESTIONS & NOTES:

1. **WHY DID I GUESS AWS AND AMZN STORE ARE THE COMPONENTS GOING THROUGH HIGH GROWTH?**  
As per 2021 Q4 earnings transcript, ""40% of that capex is going into infrastructure, most of it feeding AWS...About just under 30% is fulfillment capacity, building warehouses -- warehouse only, not transportation. And then just under 25% is transportation capacity and building on our NACL network, principally globally."" So we can see AMZN believes in the growth of AMZN store and AWS so I think it's justified in my DCF to assume high growth for both.
2. **WHY DOES HIGH GROWTH STOP IN 2025?**  
AMZN’s actual valuation is very heavily dependent on how long the high growth period lasts for. No guidance was given for how long this period is going to be, but a decent guess for this would probably be 2 years from 2023. 2022 was a period of contraction from AMZN navigating higher labor costs and the Ukraine War. 2023 would be a good starting point for AMZN to begin expansion. Given that the AMZN network took 2 years to double. If 2 years later it doubles again to quadruple it is most likely able to also support other regions outside of the US to a competent degree.
3. **INACCURACY IN FORECASTING ADVERTISING**  
Data available for advertising is actually quite limited due to a lack of information from management and historically advertising has only been reported from 2019 onwards. As more financial reports become available for advertising the degree of accuracy of prediction increases, unfortunately only 3 years of data from 2019 - 2021 is available. The story for advertising business in AMZN is sadly just too murky and vague right now for me to paint you guys a decent scene.
4. **How much AMZN’s margins are actually going to be after the high growth period?**   historically AMZN always had low margins as they reinvested back heavily to the company. Once again a lack of suitable historical data, where we can observe how high margins could be with an average economical condition and with all investments paying off. 9% may be cutting it too little for AMZN, but better safe than sorry.
5. **LASTLY,**   
All my forecasting are based on me weighing all the factors and adjusting their impact according to how much impact I think they have. 

# CONCLUSION:

Ultimately, I value AMZN at $115.61, it is undervalued compared to market's $84. This difference can probably be attributable to how strong the market thinks AMZN's high growth will be compared to mine. But, I do think that there are a lot of doomsayers especially in the news where literally every other day I'd open my preferred news app and see at least 3 different article about how inflation has not eased off to a great extent. Barring short term expectations, I really do see AMZN being a strong company with great free cash flow potential. 2022's 10-K is definitely going to make or break how investors view AMZN moving forward, Questions like ""Can AMZN finally break their negative CF?"" will finally have an answer and give investor some kind of confidence. 4/5 of AMZN's revenue sources are cyclical so they'd be overly affected by the current environment's pessimism.   
I see this 37% of difference in price not as risk but rather as an opportunity because I believe AMZN will minimally bounce back 37% sometime in the future, the question is just when.

For the last time, I appreciate any advice or comments on my DCF I really spent quite a lot of time on this DCF juggling between scouring for data and army left me literally devoting 70% of my weekends getting data. I've read the story AMZN has told and retold it in my own account and I hope this value adds to anyone even if no advice was given!

GOOG,Why I Love GOOG and GOOGL,462,297,1673911483,"( current investment = \~1000 in GOOG and GOOGL )

I really like google due to two reasons: **its ""conglomerate-like"" build, as well as its experimentation.**

With major positions surrounding the tech industry from **Google Search**, to YouTube, to the Pixel Phone, to the Android OS, to the Google Nest, to Chromebooks, to Google Drive & Gmail and more! There's so many different areas in the tech space which Google either conquers (in terms of Google Search which holds close to 85% of search engine use according to [Statistica](https://www.statista.com/statistics/216573/worldwide-market-share-of-search-engines/#:~:text=As%20of%20December%202022%2C%20online,share%20of%20around%2084.08%20percent).

Google also owns the 2nd most used social media **Youtube**, according to [Statistica](https://www.statista.com/statistics/272014/global-social-networks-ranked-by-number-of-users/). Youtube maintains its place as ""the place to go for long-form video watching."" DIY, its on YouTube. You need to learn something? It's on Youtube. They make most of their Youtube money through the advertising, yet they also make money through Youtube Premium and Youtube TV. YouTube Premium is able to profit off of content that millions make and just have to give a commission to the creators rather than using funds before making it like Netflix and other streamers must do for their content. 

**YouTube TV** gives Google the ability to compete in the expanding streaming industry against giants such as Netflix and Disney. They have a built-out subscription model which collects revenue monthly through its users.

Google's ownership of **Android**, as well as the Pixel phone hardware line gives them a vertical integration in order to have a more powerful stance over the abilities of their phones. This gives them more options for supply chain management and optimization as well as they don;t have to rely on another company for implementation of the hardware itself.

The **Google Play Store** is also one of the only competitors to the App Store. [It generated 10.34 billion in JUST Q3 of Last year](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/app-revenues/). Several million have used the store in order to install apps, as well as many creators prefer it to the app store, due to its more lax rules on app requirements.

**Chromebooks** as well as the Google Workspace are huge revenue-generating segments that intertwine Google with education (as kids in school are using Chromebooks and Google Classroom) as well as the professional world. While Chromebooks may not be extremely powerful machines, they address a market for the people who simply want a simple computer that they can complete simple online tasks with. Google sold roughly [30 million Chromebooks](https://www.statista.com/statistics/749890/worldwide-chromebook-unit-shipments/) in 2022 alone, showing that demand is for sure still there.

Google has **Google Workspace**, a fierce competitor to Microsoft's 365 (Office). While Microsoft does conquer this product type, Google does hold a fair amount of market share and recognition in its Google Workspace (G Suite) product. 

Google is also working on **Flutter**: an open-source UI software development kit which is used to develop cross-platform applications for Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, Windows, Google Fuchsia, and the web from a single codebase.

Google also has several different speculative ""moonshots"" as they refer to them which furthers Google place as an ""unconventional"" company which can use its innovative edge to pass competitors and conquer the industries in which it involves itself with.

GOOG,Apple's business is simply an earnings machine. ROC comparison: Apple (23.7%) vs. Alphabet (12.3%) vs. Amazon (5.7%),1198,204,1674316790,"Source: Apple: Why Recent Underperformance Is A Buying Opportunity

Over the last few months, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock has done something that it doesn't often do: underperform. Since the company's last earnings call on October 27th, the stock has broken away from the broader market, returning -4% while the S&P 500 (SPY) has delivered 8.5%.

The reason for this short-term underperformance isn't exactly obvious. Apple, after all, reported record revenues in its October earnings release, and Tim Cook announced that the company has yet to feel the sting of consumer softness in the economy.

Investors, however, don't seem to have believed him.

From worries about production issues in China to softening demand for the iPhone that investors seem certain will materialize at some point, investors just seem plain worried that something will go awry at the world's largest company. We contend in this article that these concerns are overblown and that the current underperformance represents a buying opportunity.

The China Worry

Apple has faced down a multitude of investor worries regarding its relationship with China. Apple has been accused of being too cozy with China, of making secret deals with China, of having its supply chain being too exposed to China, and of being cowardly when it comes to China.

While the veracity of these claims are better left to other authors, we don't think we're overstepping by saying that China has been made into a bogeyman for Apple investors. Apple has arguably done better than almost any other American corporation at walking the fine line that western companies must navigate in order to successfully do business in China.

The current top-of-mind China worries for Apple investors, however, are supply-chain issues and questions surrounding lockdowns and China's notorious zero-COVID policy. As long as the country is locking up millions of its citizens in forced isolation, things will be difficult for Apple.

Investors were delivered good news recently, then, when Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal reported that Chinese officials were scaling back COVID lockdowns, potentially re-opening the economy at a much faster pace than expected. Importantly, Vice Premier Hiu Le told an audience at Davos that Beijing's focus this year would be on ""boosting domestic demand.""

In other words, we believe that Chinese leadership's struggles with large scale problems such as population decline and slumping economic growth make it less likely to rock the boat with Apple, at least in the near term.

All of this bodes well for Apple's business in China, which beat analyst estimates last quarter with $15.6 billion in revenue. Apple further stands to gain in the near term from the collapse of the U.S. dollar's 2022 rally.

A strong dollar reduces a company's international sales because when revenues are recorded in dollars (as Apple's are), they must be converted. When one Yuan converts to fewer and fewer dollars, the effects on the income statement quickly mount. Thus, the dollar's recent decline is good news for Apple and American companies conducting business overseas in general. The easing of FX headwinds should give Apple's international sales--and Chinese sales in particular--a welcome boost.

A Robust Product Pipeline

Steve Jobs is rumored to have said at one point that Tim Cook wasn't ""a product guy."" The long line of releases that Apple has in store for 2023 would probably beg to differ.

Only three weeks into the new year, Apple has already re-launched its HomePod product as well as a slew of new Mac variations. A full list of potential releases can be found here, but amidst the rumors of an Apple Car, something else very interesting has emerged--an Apple VR headset, reportedly ready for launch this year.

This is the product that, we think, should keep Mark Zuckerberg awake at night. Meta (META) has been at the forefront of the VR headset realm for some time since it purchased Oculus in 2014. Widespread adoption of the technology, however, has been a bit slow to catch on, which could have something to do with the fact that Meta is not principally a hardware company.

Apple, of course doesn't have this problem. If the product does in fact launch in 2023, we expect that it will be maniacally engineered and deliver a user experience unmatched by current technology. Combine this with Apple's dedicated user base and app ecosystem, as well as Apple's influence with developers, and it's quite possible to envision Apple launching VR adoption into the mainstream.

History is on our side with this claim. At its launch the iPad was met with a notorious level of criticism. Many companies had attempted to create a tablet in previous years (including Apple--remember the Newton?), but just couldn't quite pull it off. The Apple Watch, too, was met with similar skepticism.

In short, if anyone can pull off a VR coup, we believe Apple can.

A Compelling Valuation

Over the past five years, Apple's stock has maintained a fairly consistent relationship to forward EBITDA.

Overlaid against each other, the stock has consistently tracked above forward EBITDA estimates. In 2022, estimates began to flatten as inflation took hold and recession fears set in and the relationship reversed, with the stock price falling beneath forward EBITDA. We believe that the current inversion of this historical relationship presents an attractive opportunity for investors. This reflects our belief that Apple's stock won't be stuck in the doldrums forever.

Analysts, too, believe that Apple has better days ahead.

Of the 45 analysts estimates tracked, the average price target is $168.82. With its current price of $135, Apple has an almost 25% upside to its consensus target.

Normally we take analyst targets with a grain of salt, but an interesting pattern seems to emerge in the lower pane of the above chart--each time Apple's stock price slumps causing the distance between price and target price to exceed 20%, the stock tends to respond to the upside.

Some investors may agree up to this point but wonder--why, in the face of rising interest rates, does Apple continue to deserve such a premium valuation? Shouldn't Apple, at some point, be affected by the same gravity that has pulled down the likes of Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL) in the last year?

We're glad you asked, because a piece of the Apple puzzle that we believe is under-reported is the company's sheer efficiency. Apple's business is simply an earnings machine, reporting world-class returns on capital quarter after quarter.


In the last 10 years, Apple has averaged an eye-popping 23.7% quarterly return on capital, and performance over the past two years has been even stronger. For reference, we prefer return on capital over other metrics such as return on equity since ROC can be directly compared to a company's estimated cost of capital. Comparing those two figures is helpful in inferring the profitability and sustainability of a business.

Now, just for kicks, let's compare Apple's reported ROC with Alphabet and Amazon.

It isn't even close. Compared with Apple's 23.7% ROC, Alphabet's average quarterly ROC over 10 years was 12.3% (the bars in white), while Amazon's was 5.7% (the bars in red).

Apple really is that good.

The Bottom Line

In sum, we believe that Apple shares present a highly compelling opportunity for investors.

Apple's business is world-class, with best-in-industry returns on capital that continue to justify a premium valuation.

Fears about China--including FX headwinds--may dissipate or prove less impactful than feared.
Apple continues to innovate and is expected to bring fresh products to market in 2023.

There currently exists a price-EBITDA discrepancy which could present a compelling entry or position building point.

We believe a price of $165 for Apple is a fair target. That price represents a 24x multiple on estimated 2024 earnings, which is well within the stock's historical multiple trading range. We believe the premium multiple is justified for the reasons outlined above.",0.95,0,0.072976766,0.036488383,21-01-2023 15:59,128.5778809,84,88.51263428,235.9478455,123.1800003

GOOG,Microsoft limits Bing A.I. chats after the chatbot had some unsettling conversations,1749,397,1676686708,"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/17/microsoft-limits-bing-ai-chats-after-the-chatbot-had-some-unsettling-conversations.html

Microsoft’s Bing AI chatbot will be capped at 50 questions per day and five question-and-answers per individual session, the company said on Friday. The move will limit some scenarios where long chat sessions can “confuse” the chat model, the company said in a blog post. The change comes after early beta testers of the chatbot, which is designed to enhance the Bing search engine, found that it could go off the rails and discuss violence, declare love, and insist that it was right when it was wrong. In a blog post earlier this week, Microsoft blamed long chat sessions of over 15 or more questions for some of the more unsettling exchanges where the bot repeated itself or gave creepy answers.

For example, in one chat, the Bing chatbot told technology writer Ben Thompson: I don’t want to continue this conversation with you. I don’t think you are a nice and respectful user. I don’t think you are a good person. I don’t think you are worth my time and energy. Now, the company will cut off long chat exchanges with the bot. Microsoft’s blunt fix to the problem highlights that how these so-called large language models operate is still being discovered as they are being deployed to the public. Microsoft said it would consider expanding the cap in the future and solicited ideas from its testers. It has said the only way to improve AI products is to put them out in the world and learn from user interactions.

Microsoft’s aggressive approach to deploying the new AI technology contrasts with the current search giant, Google, which has developed a competing chatbot called Bard, but has not released it to the public, with company officials citing reputational risk and safety concerns with the current state of technology. Google is enlisting its employees to check Bard AI’s answers and even make corrections, CNBC previously reported.",0.96,-0.5,0.093560606,-0.203219697,18-02-2023 02:18,128.5778809,84,88.51263428,235.9478455,123.1800003

TSLA,"TSLA plant in Monterrey, Mexico confirmed",654,136,1677605713,"Rumors have been circulating for at least a couple months, but confirmed now by President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador: Tesla is set to build a brand new plant in Monterrey, Mexico. This is a huge boost for Mexico, as it's trying to establish itself as a hub for investment by bringing manufacturing capacity to North America and away from Asia, thanks to geopolitical tensions and supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Lopez Obrador revealed that he had a call with Elon Musk on Monday, and they came to an agreement that will create lots of jobs and bring in a considerable investment. The President had previously expressed concerns over water shortages, but Musk was receptive and has accepted Mexico's proposals.

This investment is a big test for Mexico's President, who has a reputation for being a bit of a resource nationalist. Some companies have been unsettled by his efforts to strengthen state control of the energy market at the expense of private capital. But with Mexico receiving its highest foreign direct investment inflows for years in 2022, it's clear that the country's lower-cost and skilled workforce is making it a global center for the car industry.

We don't know all the details just yet, but Lopez Obrador said Tesla will likely give us more information tomorrow. It's all happening during Musk's ""Investor Day,"" where he'll outline his ""Master Plan Part Three.""

Not sure whether to buy calls or puts on Musk? Here's a strategy so you don't have to be married to one direction. With this ratio spread you can make up to 14% (20% annualized) AND still be protected if TSLA dips. TSLA can fall to $125 (40% drop) before losing any capital.

""Apple Inc. (AAPL), the world's most valuable company, is mulling a billion-plus dollar foray into movie theaters and sports streaming in an attempt to drive subscriber growth for its Apple TV+ streaming platform.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
Apple could spend more than $1 billion a year to ramp up its movie releases and sports streaming.

The company is reportedly in talks with film studios to partner on theatrical releases of movies by Martin Scorsese and Ridley Scott.

Previously, Apple has devoted most of its $6.5 billion film and TV budget to television programs.

The move could help to drive viewers to Apple's streaming platform, Apple TV+, which lags far behind competitors like Amazon and Netflix.

Apple is expected to spend $1 billion a year to produce movies for theatrical release. 

The company is reportedly in talks with movie studios to partner on the releases of upcoming movies by Martin Scorsese, Ridley Scott, and others.

The company is also reportedly considering bidding on the streaming rights to English football games.


The new plans constitute a significant increase in Apple's entertainment spending that could be part of an effort to draw more interest in Apple TV+, which lags behind rivals in subscriptions. Apple TV+ has an estimated 40 million subscribers, compared with at least 200 million each for Amazon's (AMZN) Prime Video and Netflix (NFLX).


Apple also lags behind rivals in content spending. The company spent about $6.5 billion on movies and television in 2021, while Amazon and Netflix spent $9 billion and $17 billion respectively.


So far, Apple's greatest streaming success has been in television, with the acclaimed series Ted Lasso. The business of releasing movies for wide theatrical distribution may be more complex, particularly given theater chains' struggles to rebound from COVID-19 and fend off competition from streaming services. Movie ticket sales are about a third below 2019 levels. Chains like AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. (AMC) have attributed the sluggish sales to a shortage of available films.

Apple's distribution agreements may help boost ticket sales, and it is not the only tech company entering theaters. Amazon acquired major studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for $8.5 billion last year and now plans to make up to 15 movies for theatrical release each year. 

In each case, Apple and Amazon may attempt to drive streaming viewership by later releasing those films on their respective platforms.

Apple's interest in adding English football games to its streaming platform follows last year's $2.5 billion 10-year streaming deal with U.S. Major League Soccer. Terms of a potential deal between Apple and the UK's Premier League have not been disclosed.""

Personally, this sounds like the kind of move that more streamers (looking at you, Netflix) need to make. They aren't going to be throwing ridiculous money at it, but the content they are looking to produce is starting to look more like HBO level quality. If they have acclaimed directors like Scorsese and Ridley Scott on board, they could get their films in with a big theatrical release, make a shit tonne of money, THEN bring it onto streaming (much like Paramount did with Top Gun Maverick) for a bigger subscriber gain.

TSLA,Tesla net income and earnings drop more than 20% from last year,3455,870,1681935275,"Tesla reported earnings after the bell. Here are the results.

Earnings per share: 85 cents adj. vs 85 cents expected, according to the average analyst estimate compiled by Refinitiv

Revenue: $23.33 billion vs $23.21 billion expected, according to Refinitiv estimates

Net income came in at $2.51 billion, down 24% from last year, while GAAP earnings came in at $0.73, down 23% from the year-ago quarter.

Automotive revenue, Tesla’s core segment, reached $19.96 billion in the quarter.

Tesla’s first-quarter earnings call will be livestreamed via Twitter, a first for the electric vehicle maker. CEO Elon Musk sold billions of dollars worth of his Tesla holdings in 2022 to finance a $44 billion buyout of the social media company, where he is now also CEO.

The company cut prices on its vehicles at the end of last year and into the first quarter of 2023, including additional cuts Tuesday night. At the same time, Tesla is charting ambitious plans for expansion and increased capital expenditures.

Revenue in the quarter likely increased 24% from $18.76 billion a year earlier, according to Refinitiv estimates.

Tesla currently sells four EV models, which are produced at two vehicle assembly plants in the U.S., one in Shanghai and another outside of Berlin.


Shareholders who submitted questions ahead of the earnings call for management’s consideration were seeking updates on the company’s trapezoidal, sci-fi inspired Cybertruck, the company’s energy division, and the timing for a new model vehicle from Tesla.

In early April, Tesla reported vehicle deliveries of 422,875 vehicles in the first quarter, the closest approximation of sales disclosed by the company. Production was slightly higher than deliveries for the first three months of 2023 at 440,808 vehicles.

A month earlier, Musk announced plans to build a Tesla factory in Monterrey, Mexico, a day’s drive from a relatively new factory in Austin, Texas. And more recently, Tesla said it plans to set up a factory to make Megapacks, or large lithium ion battery-based energy storage systems, in Shanghai.

According to a financial filing published in late January, Tesla expected to spend between $7 billion and $9 billion in 2024 and 2025, an increase in capital expenditures of about $1 billion in the next two years.

Tesla shares have rebounded this year from a dismal 2022, when they lost about two-thirds of their value alongside a plunge in tech companies. The stock is up 48% in 2023.

MSFT,Britain blocks Microsoft’s $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard,3181,594,1682508059,"LONDON — Britain’s top competition regulator on Wednesday moved to block[ Microsoft](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT/)’s acquisition of video game publisher [Activision Blizzard](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/ATVI/).

The  measure marks a major blow for the U.S. tech giant, as it seeks to  convince authorities that the deal will benefit competition.

Microsoft said it plans to appeal the decision.

The  U.K. Competition and Markets Authority said that it opposed the deal as  it raises competition concerns in the nascent cloud gaming market.

Microsoft  could make Activision’s games exclusive to its cloud gaming platform,  Xbox Game Pass, cuting off distribution to other key players in the  space, the CMA said.

Cloud gaming is a technology that enables  gamers to access games via companies’ remote servers — effectively  streaming a game like you would a movie on Netflix. The technology is  still in its infancy, but Microsoft is betting big on it becoming a  mainstream way of playing games.

Microsoft announced its intention to acquire Activision Blizzard in January 2022 for $69 billion, in [one of the biggest deals the video game industry has seen](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/18/microsoft-to-buy-activision.html) to date.

Executives  at the Redmond, Washington-based technology giant believe the  acquisition will boost its efforts in gaming by adding lucrative  franchises like Call of Duty and Candy Crush Saga to its content  offerings.

However, some of Microsoft’s competitors contested the  deal, concerned it may give Microsoft a tight grip on the $200 billion  games market. Of particular concern was the prospect that Microsoft [may shut off distribution access to Activision’s popular Call of Duty franchise](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2022/09/16/microsoft-is-growing-tired-of-sonys-call-of-duty-complaints/?sh=bd568595ebb9) for certain platforms.

[Sony](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/6758.T-JP/), in particular, has voiced concern with Microsoft’s Activision purchase.  The Japanese gaming giant fears that Microsoft could make Call of Duty  exclusive to its Xbox consoles in the long run. 

 Microsoft sought to allay those concerns by offering Sony, [Nintendo](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/7974.T-JP/), [Nvidia](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/)

and other firms [10-year agreements](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/07/microsoft-says-it-will-bring-call-of-duty-to-nintendo-for-10-years.html) to continue bringing Call of Duty to their respective gaming platforms.

Microsoft  argues it wouldn’t be financially beneficial to withhold Call of Duty  from PlayStation, Nintendo and other rivals given the licensing income  it generates from keeping the game available on their platforms.

Microsoft  President Brad Smith told CNBC last month that the company is offering  Sony the same agreement as it did Nintendo — to make Call of Duty  available on PlayStation at the same time as on Xbox, with the same  features. Sony still opposes the deal.

The CMA had raised concerns  with the potential for Microsoft to hinder competition in the nascent  cloud gaming market via its Xbox Game Pass subscription service, which  offers cloud gaming among its perks. Microsoft has committed to bring  new Call of Duty titles to Xbox Game Pass on day one of its release.

Cloud  gaming, or the ability to access games via PC or mobile devices over  the internet, is still in its infancy and requires a strong broadband  connection to work well. According to network intelligence firm  Sandvine, cloud gaming made up less than 1% of global internet traffic  in 2022.

Even with the CMA’s blessing, Microsoft will still need to convince other regulators not to block the deal. The EU [continues to probe the merger](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/21/microsoft-will-bring-xbox-games-to-nvidias-cloud-gaming-service.html) to assess whether it hurts competition, while the U.S. Federal Trade Commission [sued to block the deal](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/08/ftc-sues-to-block-microsofts-acquisition-of-game-giant-activision-blizzard.html) on antitrust grounds.

Despite their significant revenue, they have seen a decline in gross margin percentage, from 38.2% in 2017 to 37.6% in 2020. This could be indicative of increased production costs or decreased pricing power.  
Furthermore, they have been spending heavily on share buybacks, with a total of $73.2 billion in 2020 alone. While this may boost earnings per share in the short term, it's also indicative of a potential lack of more productive investment opportunities.  
In addition, while Apple's been investing in AI, they seem to be lagging behind competitors like Google and OpenAI.

MSFT,MSFT is baking in massive AI revenue streams. Is it really going to boost profits like the hype?,42,90,1685463220,"Long term holder of MSFT here. To be fair I think MSFT is making a good move getting out in front of this trend and getting a big foothold in the industry. However cool the tech is I find it very hard to believe the stock run up is warranted to this level based on what I saw at build. Couple of points I think ""bear"" considering.

1. How many employers are going to pay extra for these features is the near future? My company has blocked most things AI citing fears of client data leaks and misuse. (co-piot, bing chat)
2. How big of a revenue boost will this really be? There is a lot of computational hardware in use behind the scenes. If you have power users hitting this all day how much is being kept in profit?
3. Azure Open AI seems to have some good use cases, but a lot of the demonstrated cases are around chat bots. Are chat bots worth a 35X + multiplier on this 2 trillion plus stock?

My view is more that MSFT has to do this to ensure they stay in the game not that this will be a major major revenue driver. For a company this large thinking PE of 35 is a bit lofty.

GOOG,Google(GOOG) DCF: AI,8,15,1685759578,"# Introduction:

With all the hype around AI and NVDA, this could be a strong catalyst for launching GOOG into its intrinsic value. Most of the climb had already taken place over the weeks. But, given that currently AI is the flavor of the month I'd be a little worried about adding more positions into GOOG. As a disclaimer, I have positions on GOOG since last year that I've been closing out and cashing in on my gains. I've linked my DCF, Revenue model and Cost model all at the bottom.

&#x200B;

# REVENUE:

  
***Cloud***  
%Rev, Cloud is an area gaining massive traction due to how much convenience it adds, And the switching cost of cloud is massive, having to port over the entire database into competitors and retraining employees, so the loyalty of Cloud customers are strong.   
So, I’d argue that Cloud starts becoming a big part of GOOG’s identity.  
  
Y/Y, Cloud grows at CAGR of 19% according to ([SOURCE](https://www.enterpriseappstoday.com/news/cloud-computing-market-size-is-projected-to-surpass-usd-2972-6)). I believe GOOG to be capable of capturing most of that 19%. But, 19% may be overly optimistic as it requires for the next 8 years about 40+% Y/Y which seems unrealistic to me, given how cloud is already such a large part of GOOG. So I used a Y/Y CAGR of 13.32%  
  
***Advertising***  
%Rev, Advertising is still going to be a big part of GOOG’s identity, however with cloud gaining traction Advertising's role may be diminished.   
  
Y/Y, Advertising will see its Y/Y tapering off rather than taking off. I’d argue that the growth of AI related technology like ChatGPT may render GOOG’s search less effective given how ChatGPT seems to be an enhanced Google Search. Luckily, GOOG's has its own contender of ChatGPT, Bard. Bard is trained on Audio data whereas ChatGPT is trained on text data, so the effectiveness of these AI is dependent on how the user inputs data for the AI to process. Ultimately, which AI will take off is dependent on which modal of communication consumers prefer.   
Recently, GOOG has announced its plans to launch Duet AI, AI to help augment the experience on both cloud and Search. It’s definitely a step forward in the right direction, Duet AI could be complementary to Google’s already dominant search as not every search will likely be using AI due to how long that would take.   
  
***Others***  
%Rev, With so many components in Others, there may be less focus placed on this segment of the business so it’ll take a smaller pie of GOOG’s revenue.  
  
Y/Y, I opted to use historical average as granularity seems to be inaccurate here.  
  


# COST:

***TAC***  
Given the competitiveness of Competing technology against GOOG’s main Traffic generator, I’d argue that it could be significantly costlier to acquire traffic overtime. Recently I've been reading Homo Deus which made a fair point about Dataism. As our data interpreter (AI) gets more and more accurate, you'd be at a disadvantage to not use AI in your day to day life. So if we have this paradigm shift of trusting and relying on AI, TAC has a huge potential of decreasing. But, given how little regulation and promising technology on AI there has been so far this may be either too far out into the future or just impossible entirely.  
  
***COST OF REVENUES***  
GOOG has lumped Content Review, Content Acquisition and Data Centre together in COST OF REVENUES.  
  
1. Content Review: Needing Employees to manually sieve through content for compliance. As the service gets more popular, more content means needing more employees. (Variable Cost) BUT I'd argue that it could be a negligible one overtime as AI gains dominance and can track content in place of humans. (Fixed Cost)  
  
2. Content Acquisition: GOOG has stated it uses a cost price model for determining the amount of content acquired. (Variable Cost)  
  
3. Data Centre: Fixed infrastructure in place, but more of Data center used means GOOG needs higher bandwidth which means higher cost (Variable Cost)  
Since these are variable costs, I’d argue the extent that GOOG can reduce these costs to improve margins are limited.  
  
***R&D***  
R&D the cornerstone of GOOG’s business philosophy will always retain a fixed % of revenue. As evident from historic data where the spread of R&D with respect to Revenue was rather small.  
So, R&D maintains a fixed % with respect to revenue. But eventually when GOOG matures, I’d argue that R&D tends downwards.  
  
***Sales & Marketing + G&A***  
Sales & Marketing + G&A also followed the same historic patterns of R&D where they always occupied the same % with respect to revenue with a small spread.  
So, Sales & Marketing + G&A occupies a fixed % with respect to revenue. But eventually when GOOG matures and develops a strong branding relies less on marketing so it tends downwards a little.   


# COST OF CAPITAL:

WACC calculation a little too messy to input here so I'll link it   
WACC: ([SOURCE](https://imgur.com/a/D48GrJl))

# CONCLUSION:

  
GOOG is priced at $146.02, GOOG’s recent innovations have been made only in response to competitors. It’s more reactive rather than proactive which may be a bad thing given how strongly ChatGPT has since established its dominance over GOOG. For GOOG to improve its valuation it needs to peer deeper into the AI realm and look towards augmenting AI to compliment its advertising segment e.g. Using AI to help advertisers or to manage Ad Inventory.

AAPL,AAPL reaches all time high in pre-market trading,674,380,1685966398,"Apple reached today a new all time high of $182.7 in pre-market. Lots of expectations around the WWDC event and their much anticipated VR announcement.

What's your personal take on this? Is it just euphoria or is Apple poised to grow even further throughout the rest of the year?",0.95,0.16,0.099272727,0.129636364,05-06-2023 11:59,128.5778809,84,88.51263428,235.9478455,123.1800003
AAPL,AAPL price dump after VR headset reveal,271,316,1685996832,"The price movement was directly correlated with the VR headset announcement along with the demo of features.

* Yes, it looks like ski goggles.
* The OS is called **Vision Pro**
* The VR OS is similar to Microsoft's Mixed Reality with their Hololens product which came out 8 years ago...

One of the **selling features** is that your eyes are visible, but the headset will conceal your eyes when you're fully immersed in an app.. which may or may not be groundbreaking as it didn't perfectly reveal your eyes (perhaps because there wasn't enough lighting inside the goggles to show your eyes clearly, but I think this could be fixed w/ software or by adding LED lights on the inside edges), however:

* If you can keep your headset on while talking to people in the room compared to the competition, this feature alone would win out

Price tag is $3500, but again this is the dev conference, so the consumer version of this product will come later, although I can see how a lot of developers might want to buy this thing (also consider that Apple has the largest developer network) compared to competitor headsets which cost 7x less (META is coming out with a $500 VR headset).

Something to note, the stock dropped nearly 1.5% during all the free features (before the VR headset) that were going to be included to existing users, however that did coincide with the market indexes dropping as well.

Total drop from the peak was around 3.5% however the stock recovered nearly a percent, today's loss is only around 0.75% after falling from making another new 52w all time high.  Trading volume was 2x the normal average, so ending red is very significant.

META & MSFT stayed relatively flat compared to AAPL.

Overall I think this was bad news for the stock in the short term; buy the rumor sell the news type event.  If the VR headset was truly revolutionary, stock price would have gone much higher, **so we have to wait & see what Apple developers can do with this headset for consumers & what Apple's actual consumer version of the headset will be.**  Than after 12 to 18 months when the killer apps come out, re-evaluate Apple's VR headset.

AAPL,AAPL stock continues climb to $3T with new trading highs,528,199,1687515871,"Apple stock (AAPL) recently bucked a year-long trend and set a new record-high closing price. Ten days later, investors are looking at a new intraday trading high as well as the highest closing price to date.  
  
The company closed at $187.00 per share today after opening at $183.74 and reaching $187.04 during trading. That puts Apple at a $2.941 trillion valuation based on market cap.  
  
Apple nearly became the first company to close with a $3 trillion company valuation in January 2022, but the peak high didn’t last through intraday trading. Apple would go on to lose $1 trillion in value by year’s end due to iPhone supply constraints bottlenecking sales.  
  
And while Apple stock saw the company’s valuation hit the $3 trillion mark last year, AAPL still hasn’t closed with a $3 trillion company valuation.  
  
Despite significant setbacks at the end of last year, it continues to look likely that Apple will close with a $3 trillion valuation in the near future. Apple is once again positioned as the most valuable company on Wall Street, with a $2.94 trillion valuation.

MSFT,Warren Buffett built a $107 billion net worth through investing. Every year since 1965 he’s written an annual letter showing us how he did it.,1143,368,1688055205,"**Here are 10 investing lessons from Warren Buffett:**

**1. What you own**  
What and how you invest matters.  
Buffett focuses on businesses with great management and economic advantages.  
The key word is business.  
Buffett isn’t a stock picker.  
He calls himself a business picker.

&#x200B;

**2. Diversification**  
Just because you’re diversified doesn’t mean you have less risk.  
And just because you have a concentrated position doesn’t mean you have more risk.  
Concentrating on a few stocks can decrease your risk if it means you’ll pay more attention to the business.

&#x200B;

**3. Market pricing**  
Buffett says a stock price shouldn’t determine whether you buy or sell.  
In the short term, people vote with their dollars on which stocks will do well.  
In the long term, stocks with the most value tend to do well.

&#x200B;

**4. Be greedy when others are fearful**  
When money is cheap, hold on to it.  
When money is expensive, invest it.  
Every so often doom and gloom will hit the stock market.  
This is your chance to run towards it with wads of cash.  
Instead of running away with pennies on the dollar.

&#x200B;

**5. Buy businesses that reinvest in themselves**  
If it’s a great company, with great management, and great profits…  
Why wouldn’t they reinvest in themselves?  
This creates an element of compound interest.  
Except instead of your returns compounding, it’s business operations.

&#x200B;

**6. Prioritize moat**  
If a business model produces high profits, there will be competition.  
Businesses that thrive like this have one thing in common:  
A moat.  
A moat doesn’t only keep them profitable, but it keeps them in competition long term.  
This is crucial for investors.

&#x200B;

**7. Buy boring businesses**  
Especially if they sell products/services people need.  
Boring businesses provide stability and longevity to your portfolio.  
This allows you to make money for longer periods of time.

&#x200B;

**8. Invest like a sloth**  
“For investors as a whole, returns decrease as motions increase.”  
Most investors would make more money if they bought and held instead of buying and trading.  
This applies to rebalancing too.  
Here’s what I mean…

&#x200B;

**9. Rebalancing your portfolio**  
Most people trim a position once it gets large.  
Buffett does the opposite.  
Selling positions that have become too big is the same as the bulls trading Michael Jordan because he’s become too good.  
Don’t sell your winners.  
Let them run.

&#x200B;

**10. Time and business**  
Time is a friend of great businesses but an enemy of the mediocre.

I just started doing this so any feedback would be appreciated. Goal is for a quick overview of the earnings report for an average person to be able to read and digest\*\*

1. Operating Activities:  
The operating activities section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows showcases how Amazon generates cash from its core business operations. In both periods, the company's operating activities generated positive cash flow. There was a significant increase in net income, showing growth from a loss of $2.03 billion in the three months ending June 30, 2022, to a profit of $6.75 billion in the same period in 2023. This highlights a remarkable improvement in Amazon's financial performance and operational efficiency.  
  
2. Investing Activities:  
Amazon invested heavily in property, equipment, and strategic acquisitions during the analyzed periods. In the three months ending June 30, 2022, the company's investments in property and equipment amounted to $15.72 billion, which decreased to $11.45 billion in the same period in 2023. While the absolute values decreased, these investments are essential for the company's long-term growth and expansion.  
  
3. Financing Activities:  
The financing activities section details Amazon's capital structure and shareholder returns. The company engaged in various financing activities, including repurchasing common stock, resulting in cash outflows of $3.33 billion in the three months ending June 30, 2023, and $6 billion in the six months ending June 30, 2022. Additionally, the company obtained proceeds from short-term debt and other financing, contributing $4.87 billion and $4.4 billion in the respective three months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023. Investors should be aware of these activities, as they impact the company's capital allocation strategy.  
  
4. Cash Position:  
Amazon maintained a strong cash position, reflecting its financial stability and liquidity. Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash increased steadily over the periods, reaching $50.07 billion at the end of the twelve months ending June 30, 2023. This signifies the company's ability to meet its short-term obligations and pursue growth opportunities.  
  
5. Debt and Interest Payments:  
The company managed its debt obligations efficiently, making principal repayments on long-term debt, finance leases, and financing obligations. Amazon also paid interest on debt, with cash outflows totaling $349 million and $954 million for the respective three months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023. These payments demonstrate responsible debt management and the company's commitment to meeting its financial obligations.  
  
6. Net Sales:  
Net sales are a fundamental indicator of Amazon's revenue growth and market performance. In the three months ending June 30, 2022, net sales reached $121.23 billion, which increased to $134.38 billion in the same period in 2023, representing an 11% year-over-year growth. Similarly, for the six months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, net sales grew from $237.68 billion to $261.74 billion, showing strong and consistent revenue growth.  
  
7. Operating Expenses:  
Operating expenses provide insights into the company's cost structure and efficiency. In the three months ending June 30, 2022, operating expenses were $117.92 billion, which increased to $126.70 billion in the same period in 2023. Over the six months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, operating expenses increased from $230.69 billion to $249.29 billion, primarily due to higher fulfillment, technology, and infrastructure costs. Despite the increase, Amazon's revenue growth outpaced the rise in operating expenses, leading to improved operating income.  
  
8. Operating Income:  
Operating income measures the profitability of Amazon's core operations. The company experienced significant growth in operating income, increasing from $3.32 billion in the three months ending June 30, 2022, to $7.68 billion in the same period in 2023. Over the six months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, operating income rose from $6.99 billion to $12.46 billion, indicating improved operational efficiency and profitability.  
  
9. Non-Operating Expense:  
The non-operating expense provides insights into Amazon's other income and expenses outside its core operations. Total non-operating expense decreased from ($5.97) billion to ($0.12) billion in the three months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, respectively. This decline was primarily due to a positive swing in other income (expense), net, indicating favorable financial management.  
  
10. Net Income (Loss):  
Net income is a critical metric that assesses Amazon's overall financial performance. The company experienced a significant improvement in net income, increasing from a loss of ($2.03) billion in the three months ending June 30, 2022, to a profit of $6.75 billion in the same period in 2023. Over the six months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, net income increased from a loss of ($5.87) billion to a profit of $9.92 billion, demonstrating a strong financial turnaround.  
  
11. Earnings Per Share (EPS):  
Earnings per share is a vital metric for shareholders, as it represents the company's profitability on a per-share basis. Basic earnings per share increased from a loss of ($0.20) to $0.66 for the three months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, respectively. Diluted earnings per share showed similar growth, rising from a loss of ($0.20) to $0.65 for the same periods.  
  
12. Other Comprehensive Income (Loss):  
Other comprehensive income (loss) includes items that impact the company's financial position but are not part of the net income calculation. For the three months ending June 30, 2022, Amazon's other comprehensive income was ($2.42) billion, which increased to $293 million for the same period in 2023. Over the six months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, other comprehensive income was ($3.41) billion and $807 million, respectively.  
  
13. Comprehensive Income (Loss):  
Comprehensive income is the total change in equity during a period, including net income and other comprehensive income. For the three months ending June 30, 2022, Amazon reported a comprehensive loss of ($4.45) billion, which improved to a comprehensive income of $7.04 billion for the same period in 2023. Over the six months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, comprehensive loss improved from ($9.28) billion to a comprehensive income of $8.33 billion, highlighting the company's financial recovery.  
  
14. Segment Information:  
Amazon operates through several segments, including North America, International, and Amazon Web Services (AWS). In the three months ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, all segments showed significant growth in net sales.  
  
•	North America: Net sales in North America increased from $80.85 billion to $87.75 billion, representing a 9% year-over-year growth.  
•	International: Net sales in the International segment grew from $31.9 billion to $37.4 billion, reflecting a 17% year-over-year growth.  
•	AWS: Amazon Web Services, the company's cloud computing segment, experienced remarkable growth, with net sales increasing from $16.37 billion to $20.2 billion, showing a 23% year-over-year growth.  
  
Conclusion:  
Amazon demonstrated robust financial performance and growth in the periods ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023. The company's operating activities generated positive cash flow, and net sales increased consistently across all segments. Investments in property, equipment, and strategic acquisitions reflect Amazon's focus on long-term growth and expansion.  
  
Although the financing activities included cash outflows related to stock repurchases, the company's strong cash position and responsible debt management position Amazon well for future growth. The substantial improvement in net income and operating income signifies improved financial performance and operational efficiency.  
  
  
  
PROs & CONs:  
Pros:  
  
•	Strong Revenue Growth: Amazon has consistently demonstrated strong revenue growth across its various segments. The company's ability to expand its customer base, introduce new products and services, and leverage its e-commerce platform has led to impressive financial performance.  
•	Diversification of Business Segments: Amazon has successfully diversified its business beyond e-commerce. The expansion into cloud computing through Amazon Web Services (AWS) has been a major growth driver, providing the company with a stable and profitable source of revenue.  
•	Innovative and Customer-Centric Approach: Amazon's relentless focus on customer satisfaction, innovative technologies like Amazon Prime, and personalized shopping experiences have helped the company build a loyal customer base and maintain a competitive edge in the market.  
•	Financial Stability and Liquidity: The company maintains a strong cash position and prudent debt management, providing it with the financial flexibility to invest in new ventures and navigate economic uncertainties.  
•	Global Reach: Amazon operates in numerous countries, allowing it to tap into diverse markets and consumer preferences worldwide. Its vast international presence positions the company for further growth and market dominance.  
•	Leading Cloud Service Provider: AWS is a dominant force in the cloud computing industry, serving a wide range of clients, from startups to large enterprises. The profitability and growth of AWS contribute significantly to Amazon's overall financial success.  
  
Cons:  
  
•	Regulatory Scrutiny: Amazon faces increasing regulatory scrutiny related to its market dominance and business practices. Antitrust concerns and accusations of unfair competition may lead to potential legal challenges and fines.  
•	Labor Practices: The company has faced criticism for its labor practices, including allegations of poor working conditions and treatment of employees at its fulfillment centers. Such negative publicity can impact Amazon's reputation and may affect its ability to attract and retain talent.  
•	Highly Competitive Markets: The e-commerce and cloud computing industries are highly competitive, with major players vying for market share. Amazon faces challenges from established competitors and emerging startups, requiring continuous investment in innovation and technology.  
•	Dependence on Global Supply Chain: Amazon's vast supply chain network is critical for delivering products to customers. Any disruptions, such as those caused by geopolitical events or natural disasters, could affect the company's operations and financial performance.  
•	Profit Margins: While Amazon experiences strong revenue growth, its profit margins have historically been relatively low. Intense competition and ongoing investments in new ventures can put pressure on the company's profitability.  
•	Environmental Impact: As a large-scale retailer and cloud services provider, Amazon's operations have an environmental impact. The company has faced criticism for its carbon footprint, and there are growing expectations from stakeholders for more significant efforts towards sustainability.  
TLDR;  
Amazon recent earnings report for the periods ending June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2023, reveals a robust financial performance and impressive revenue growth across its segments. The company generated positive cash flow from operating activities, showing a significant increase in net income, indicating improved financial health and operational efficiency. Amazon's strategic investments in property, equipment, and acquisitions demonstrate a focus on long-term growth and expansion. With a strong cash position and responsible debt management, the company exhibits financial stability and flexibility. However, regulatory scrutiny, labor practices, and intense competition pose potential challenges. Despite these, Amazon remains a leading player in the e-commerce and cloud computing industries, presenting attractive prospects for investors seeking exposure to a market-dominant, innovative, and customer-centric company with a history of success and growth.

AAPL,"China plans to expand its ban on iPhones, AAPL drops 3%+",772,399,1694092544,"**China plans to expand a ban on the use of iPhones in sensitive departments** to government-backed agencies and state companies, a sign of growing challenges for Apple Inc. in its biggest foreign market and global production base.

Several agencies have begun instructing staff not to bring their iPhones to work, people familiar with the matter said, affirming a previous report from the Wall Street Journal. In addition, **Beijing intends to extend that restriction far more broadly to a plethora of state-owned enterprises and other government-controlled organizations**, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing a sensitive matter.

If Beijing goes ahead, **the unprecedented blockade will be the culmination of a yearslong effort to root out foreign technology use** in sensitive environments, coinciding with Beijing’s effort to reduce its reliance on American software and circuitry. It **threatens to erode Apple’s position in a market that yields about a fifth of its revenue**, and from where it makes the majority of the world’s iPhones through sprawling factories that employ millions of Chinese.

Chinese state firms like oil giant PetroChina Co. employ millions and control vast swathes of a centrally planned economy. Given Apple’s relationship with Beijing and its importance to the economy, it “has historically been viewed as relatively safe in China from government restrictions,” KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Brandon Nispel said in a report Wednesday. “Is the government changing its stance?”

TSLA,What would need to happen for TSLA to *not* be overvalued today?,91,275,1695150684,"Currently TSLA is trading close to $265/share, or about an $880B market cap.

It's a reasonable argument that if an asset can beat the S&P 500 CAGR, then it's a good investment. Given that the S&P typically provides a 5% CAGR, let's see what would be needed for Tesla to achieve a 10% CAGR by, let's say.. end of 2030.

$880B \* 1.10\^7 = $1.71T market cap, or about $512/share

So how does Tesla make it to a $1.7T market cap in 2030? I'm going to assume a 30 P/E, which everyone will bitch and complain about beause they hate Tesla, but I think there's reasonable arguments for and against 30. The ""for"" argument being that I believe they'll still be growing EV sales and energy storage products. If a 30 P/E, then Tesla needs:

$1710B / 30 = $57B in gaap earnings

So how much gaap earnings does Tesla make per EV sold? I'll link to a graph of the ""TTM avg gaap earnings per EV sold"" in the comments

Tesla's current earnings profitability is about $5,600 per EV sold, and it continues to go up over the long term, even if rates have caused a recent drop (earnings per EV maxed out at $10.3k in q1 2022). Let's just assume a long term profitability of $5,700 per EV (super conservative imo). Tesla will need to sell about

$57B earnings / $5,700 earnings per EV = 10M EVs annually

Conclusion: If Tesla sells 10M EVs in 2030, then it is not overvalued today, in fact.. it beats the S&P.

AMZN,Does $HIMS have a chance against $AMZN ???,24,42,1696979874," I am now convinced [$HIMS](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24HIMS&src=cashtag_click) is so undervalued due to [$AMZN](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24AMZN&src=cashtag_click) launching Amazon Clinic last month nationwide in the US. I have done some research on the competitive landscape Hims is up against! 

1) Amazon Healthcare offers “multiple telehealth provider groups” who each set their own rates for service. The company says those visits will cost an average of $75. And $35 for a messaging session. (No insurance is accepted). I went through the sign up process for this, and it was similar to making an Amazon purchase - simple and quick. It's definitely a large competitive threat. But the platform is cut and dry and doesn't offer the educational material or specialized treatments that [$hims](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24hims&src=cashtag_click) does. Additionally the brand may not ""feel"" trustworthy to some with their personal health information either, IMO. Amazon has work to do on their branding power in this space. Nonetheless, I have no doubt they will be a leader in the space.  

2) Teledoc - works with all major insurance carriers. The website seems a decade or 2 old for the sign up process. [$TDOC](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TDOC&src=cashtag_click) is a ""stayer"" in the space for the foreseeable future due to being grandfathered in with the insurance companies and regulators. The management has taken some large missteps recently in overpaying in purchasing other companies. I dont see them as a long term threat to [$hims](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24hims&src=cashtag_click) because their innovation is lacking, and management does not seem like a bootstrapping company like [$hims](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24hims&src=cashtag_click). Not to mention, their branding is B2B, so I get the impression they are not investing in their image/branding, which could hurt them later.  

3) [$HIMS](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24HIMS&src=cashtag_click) has a major advantage in this space of being one of the only major founder led companies that is a fearless innovator. While being a company focused only on healthcare, dominating multiple segments in a short period, and starting to branch out into multiple segments. Further, the B2C branding, I believe, will help them win in the long run as they build trust with the public. I believe any telehealth company should invest in building this trust the same way your local hospital builds trust with their local community.  

Conclusion- [$AMZN](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24AMZN&src=cashtag_click) is their largest competitive threat, IMO, but as [$NFLX](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24NFLX&src=cashtag_click) has been able to survive/thrive in the streaming space against Amazon, I don't see any reason Hims can't do the same. I believe Hims is an exciting shopping experience where you can get expert information and personalized products at a great price. A great thing about [$HIMS](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24HIMS&src=cashtag_click) as well is the no judgment experience, discreet packaging, and the trustworthy reputation they're building when dealing with HIPPA. [$AMZN](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24AMZN&src=cashtag_click)'s threat is convenience, price, deep pockets, and efficiency. However, when it comes to health, I think people will want the personalized service. It is not the same as ordering dog food and toilet paper online. One downside I've seen as well is that Amazon is basing part of their clinic business on collecting your data. I believe there will be a decent percentage of people who will not trust ""big evil"" Amazon with their personal health data. It is difficult to do a really good competitive analysis because some of this is still speculation since [$hims](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24hims&src=cashtag_click) and [$amzn](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24amzn&src=cashtag_click) are so new in the space. A lot of segments are yet to be penetrated, and neither are able to accept insurance yet. I believe these 2 will end up taking most of the space while [$tdoc](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24tdoc&src=cashtag_click) gets left behind.

TSLA,We Should Start Worrying about Tesla (TSLA),352,547,1698591587,"\*\* I have no position that is impacted by this post\*\*

Over the past few years, TSLA has performed nothing short of extraordinary. In the last five years, Tesla stock has almost 10x its value. The 857% total return of Tesla is substantially higher than all of its peers, including Ford, Toyota, and Volkswagen

Despite strong growth, weakness has begun to present itself within the Wall Street prince in the past year. Tesla announced earlier in February 2023 that it would be cutting prices on the Model Y. This move surprised investors because, before the price cuts, Tesla appeared to be entirely supply-side constrained. However, investors noted that these cuts only impacted higher-end models that were outside the range of the mass vehicle market. However, in April, Tesla announced that it would be cutting prices on the Model 3. Elon Musk has previously alluded to a poor performing EV market in the wake of a higher interest rate environment. Economic data confirms this narrative as Automobile shipments have declined substantially in Q3’ 2023.

However, two factors that cannot be explained by an adverse economic environment are Full Self-Driving (FSD) and Cybertruck demand. FSD is Tesla’s end-to-end autonomous driving solution.

Tesla’s FSD is considered a level 2 autonomous driving solution. Level 2 systems require the driver to remain alert at all times with the anticipation that driver will have to take over in every circumstance. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has repeatedly claimed that FSD would be finished by the end of the year for the past six years. Additionally, Musk has claimed that robo-taxis, completely automated taxi services would be available during the same timeframes. Tesla’s current FSD beta boasts some impressive technologies, including the ability to navigate through city streets without immediate intervention in many cases. However, level 3 seems to be uncertain  for the car company. On the other hand, Tesla’s competitors such as Waymo, Mobileye, and Cruise have all operated in some capacity at level 3 or level 4. In particular, Mobileye has proved to be a serious threat to FSD due to its goal of integrating in Tesla’s competitors. Mobileye has outlined several technologies that are set to compete with Tesla’s current offerings as well as Tesla’s future capabilities.

The Cybertruck further highlights Tesla’s habit of misleading shareholders. The Cybertruck is Tesla’s consumer pickup truck expected to be launched in Q4 2023. In Tesla’s Q2 2023 earnings call, Musk stated that Cybertruck demand is, ""so off the hook, you can’t even see the hook.” EV insider reported that this statement was likely to transfer into 1.9 million preorders. However, Tesla failed to mention that the Cybertruck’s preorder deposit was $100. In Tesla’s Q3 earnings call, Musk stated that “We dug our own grave” when referring to Cybertruck. He noted that he expects it to be 18 months before Cybertruck is cash flow positive, adding another timeline onto a timeline full of delays. Musk still sees demand surpassing one million units. However, it seems unlikely that demand will be that high, considering high interest rate environment and mere $100 commitment by prospective buyers.",0.76,0,0.03295306,0.01647653,29-10-2023 14:59,128.5778809,84,88.51263428,235.9478455,123.1800003
MSFT,Did the era of cheap money create new monopoly?,324,161,1699129181,"It may not seem relevant to investing but here we go. 

Back in the days, Rocketfeller was broken into smaller companies due to its monopoly on oil. 

Nowadays I’ve heard that there are only three companies that control meat processing. The eyeglasses sector is pretty much consolidated. 
MSFT and Meta took over a lot of small companies. There were used to be 200 defense contract companies. But now it’s down to six. 

I wonder if these mergers and acquisitions has happened due to cheap,  zero percent interest rate borrowing. 

If this trend continues, it’s no brainer to buy mega caps that have major market share over  many different sectors. 

Any thought?

MSFT,Sold my Birth Day Stock,2118,397,1699476962,"Today I sold almost all of my position in MSFT, which I've held since I was born. On my birth day, my grandparents bought a number of shares for me, which my parents told me about when I turned 18. 

This is the second time I've sold any of it, the first time was when my dad showed me how to even sell a stock. We sold a portion to help pay for my college tuition. Over the years there were definitely times I wanted to sell for dumb reasons, like wanting to buy a new car, or start using it for options trading, or reinvest in some other fad. But I held off. 

Now, I need the money for a down payment on a first home for my wife and I. This ticker has always been in my brokerage account alongside every other trade I've done. It was really hard selling it, but I know it's exactly why I've been holding it all these years. Now, it's giving me the opportunity to afford a home for my family, and I am unspeakably grateful. 

I'm fortunate enough that my grandparents are still around and I can tell them myself how much of a gift they gave me all those years ago. I kept a few shares for the sentimentality, maybe I'll pass them down someday too. 

Net profit of 11,093% (estimated from MSFT's average on my birth year, it's been so long that the brokerage doesn't have the cost basis anymore)",0.95,0,-0.00744285,-0.003721425,08-11-2023 20:56,128.5778809,84,88.51263428,235.9478455,123.1800003
AMZN,Would you fire my advisor?,242,298,1699591244,"I moved to a new financial advisor in July 2022. Portfolio value at the time was $800K. They sold all but two of my existing stocks (AAPL, AMZN) and invested heavily (but not exclusively) in consumer discretionary stocks. Results: 2022 down 11%, 2023 down almost 9% YTD. Overall, down close to 20%. 

The new portfolio is extremely volatile, usually 1-2% swings each day, but today it went down ~4% due to huge losses in just two stocks. Some individual stocks are down 55-70% YTD; few are in the black. Just about every stock is performing worse than its respective market index. 

In the case of the biggest losers, the chief investment officer basically went to the sunk cost fallacy - we (I) have lost so much we should just hold to see what can be recovered.  

Right now I’m so angry about today’s loss (I didn’t mention the stock that lost 25% yesterday) that I dare not call or email until I can get a grip on my emotions.

I know that maybe except for the S&P 500, the market’s performance has not been great this year, but my portfolio’s losses just seem so extreme that I think I need to stop working with these folks. 

Any constructive advice? Thanks.",0.84,0,-0.035038573,-0.017519286,10-11-2023 04:40,128.5778809,84,88.51263428,235.9478455,123.1800003
GOOG,"""Magnificent 7"" vs S&P 500?",515,327,1700131104,"I really don't like the *""Magnificent 7""* name at all, but since everyone has adopted it, let's just roll with it. For those who don't know the Magnificent 7 are: **AAPL, GOOG, MSFT, AMZN, META, TSLA, NVDA.** With a combined market cap of **more than $11 trillion**, they currently make up approx. **29% of the S&P 500's market cap.** 

The 7 giants have gained **71%** so far this year while the rest of the 493 stocks included in the benchmark index have gained 6%. They have also outperformed all other stocks in terms of growth, profit margins and forward EPS growth, and have stronger balance sheets. 

Most analysts expect that the M7 will continue to outperform all other companies until 2025 at least. 

Now I know this is a ""stocks"" subreddit but just like the majority of retail investors, a large chunk of my portfolio is alocated to an S&P 500 ETF.

So I am actually considering instead of DCAing into a broad index ETF, why don't I just DCA into those 7? Maybe even swap META & TSLA since I am not rly a big fan of, with other 2-3 large caps that I favor, like AMD, and ADBE.

Should we expect these 7 to continue outperforming the rest of the world? Should we consider cyclicality? There's no doubt that all 7 of these companies are leaders and are probably not going anywhere in the near future. Nowdays it's as difficult as ever to overtake these giants, imo.",0.9,1,0.142951128,0.571475564,16-11-2023 10:38,128.5778809,84,88.51263428,235.9478455,123.1800003
AAPL,"7 years from $0 to $100k, 3 years from $100k to $200k",1688,281,1700326297,"I joined eTrade in 2013 a few years after graduating college. I had set up automatic monthly contributions to my accounts, which I slowly raised over time and mostly invested in blue chip stocks. 

On December 1, 2020, the combined value of my Roth and Traditional Brokerage account was just over $100k. It took me over seven years to get there and was a major milestone.  In the past three years, I have raised my monthly contributions, continued to invest, and am now just shy of $200k at the age of 35. You read about the power of compound gains all the time, but to go from $100k to $200k in three years when the first $100k took seven years is a testiment to that fact.  My goal is $1 mil by 47 and eventually to hit $2.5 mil before I retire. 

For all you youngins out there, stick with it! But also, don't rush the process and try to hit home runs every day. For the most part, I am a buy and hold investor after a year or two of trying my hand at day trading with options and futures. When you chase the money, you won't make it. But if you’re patient with a decent risk tolerance, anything is possible. 



Edit: Wow, thanks for the up votes everyone. It’s been fun reading the comments. Adding some context here based on some of the questions that have come in. Monthly contributions are at $1,000 a month now, but in the early years they were less. When I first started, it was $100 a month and I worked my way up from there. There was a good chunk of time where they were between $200-$500 a month. These accounts were set up on my own, no employer match. I’m not sure what my lifetime performance is, but the last three years I’m up 30% overall. All that in mind, I can confidently say that well over half of my account is due to investment gains. 

Investments have been all individual stocks that I typically hold for a year or longer. I pick them based on both technical and fundamental factors. This is more risky than ETFs and index funds but it suits my investing style and risk tolerance. I try to stick to profitable companies with a stock price that has a history of moving in the right direction, however I also like to buy at a discount price. I keep my eyes on charts and when there’s opportunities to buy at historically undervalued prices I jump on it. There’s really nothing super special to it. Not going to share my current exact portfolio, but stocks I have owned in the past or currently include AAPL, GOOGL, META, COST, HD, MCD, DKNG, AMD, DIS, and BAC to name a few. There are many others I’m interested in buying that are on my watchlist.

I will also add that I’ve made a ton of mistakes along the way. Bad investments, selling too soon when I should of just held, taking risky, over leveraged day trades that resulted in nasty losses and wash sales. However, I’ve learned from them and never done anything bad enough that blew an account or resulted in a draw down that couldn’t be recovered. You can read all the books you want but I’ve always found that the best way is to learn by doing and over time you develop your own skills and are able to trust your own analysis and decisions.",0.93,0,0.088966698,0.044483349,18-11-2023 16:51,128.5778809,84,88.51263428,235.9478455,123.1800003

Jeff Bezos is reportedly looking to offload more of his stake in Amazon. The former CEO is looking to sell up to 10 million shares. This is according to a report out from CNBC, which comes after he already shelled up just about $240 million worth of the stock last week. Now, Bezos still owns 988 million Amazon shares.

I got into IRBT because it seemed that if Microsoft was allowed to acquire Activision, AMZN should be able to acquire a vacuume company, no issue, right? Right? 

It seemed like the risk to reward was there but I think the moral of the story is: don’t buy garbage companies and expect them to fly up. I have played various other merger plays with good success but this one went against my idea of buying decent companies. **Without the merger, IRBT is still overvalued at current prices.**

If you are still in this, the risks of blockage are higher than I expected because AMZN isn’t willing to play ball. Also, considering AMZN dropped the acquisition price previously, it is possible they will drop it again due to the massive drop in price recently. Good luck to anyone who is still playing this. 

All and all, lost a good chunk of money, sold, and I’ve learned my lesson: **if you aren’t willing to hold the underlying, don’t buy it just solely for the merger.**",0.91,0,0.241904762,0.120952381,19-01-2024 15:17,128.5778809,84,88.51263428,235.9478455,123.1800003

Overall top line revenue of $86.1Bn grew 13% - third quarter of revenue growth after dipping in 2022. 

**Cloud roared back to 26% growth at $9.19Bn after a muted Q3** \- that should dispel any notion that Google Cloud can’t compete with Azure or AWS, or simply doesn’t have the AI tools. It implies that Google Cloud is just crossing above a $36 billion annual run rate. Margins improved - operating margin in Q4 came in at 9% compared to 3% in the previous quarter and (0.2%) in Q4 last year.  
Google Cloud is continuing to close this growth rate gap with Azure, and may surpass Azure leveraging AI. Like AWS and Azure, Google Cloud is seeing strong momentum with AI products, which is helping it win and upsell deals. Management said that the “strong demand we are seeing for our vertically integrated AI portfolio is creating new opportunities for Google Cloud across every product area,”  
CEO Sundar Pichai said that “greater than 70% of gen AI unicorns are using Google Cloud,” and customers including Anthropic and Mistral AI are building and serving LLMs on Google Cloud’s AI Hypercomputer, which combines Google’s “TPUs and GPUs, AI software and Multislice and Multi-host technology to provide performance and cost advantages for training and serving models.”  
**Is Alphabet monetizing AI? Yes**  
1. Google Cloud is charging $30/month via subscriptions with Duet AI and management noted that customers are “increasingly choosing Duet AI” to “boost productivity and improve their operations.” This is a competing product with GPT 4 - Duet AI will incorporate Google’s Gemini, its multi-modal family of LLMs developed to challenge OpenAI’s GPT-4. Google Cloud ""is intensely focused on bringing the benefits of Gemini” to its cloud customers, and the rollout of the top iteration,  
2. Gemini Ultra, at a $20/month subscription could help Google gain share away from OpenAI and thus Azure while increasing revenue.

**Net Profit jumped 52% to $20.69 billion, or $1.64 per share, (This was in spite of $1.2Bn severance charges)**  
Subscriptions are a $15Bn business now, led mostly by You Tube.  
**Alphabet is an extremely profitable company, it has an operating profit margin of 27%! — that too after all the massive spending on other bets such as Waymo, CAPEX on Al, etc.**

GOOG,Google (GOOG) DCF Analysis,62,42,1707999908,"**NOTE NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE**

# Introduction:

GOOG has a very simplistic goal in their business, yet this simple goal managed to carry GOOG's market cap to a trillion dollar. GOOG's main business model is centered around helping consumers sieve through large chunks of data to find what they need or want to find. Recently, with the announcement of Gemini, GOOG's GenAI, it led to a temporary spike in stock prices as investors believed that Gemini would be able to compete with ChatGPT. I believe that the advancement of GenAI is necessary for GOOG given how reliant they are on Search revenue.

# Revenue:

The success of GOOG’s advertising is hinged on 2 criteria, being able to attract and retain users and being able to monetize advertisers.

***For attracting and retaining users,***

1. GOOG released Gemini their generative AI to help complement Search. This allows users to process information faster or seek answers more efficiently.
2. GOOG has entered into a deal with AAPL to make Google the default search engine on Safari. This deal is estimated to be worth about 18 billion per year.
3. There is a large switching cost for long-term users to switch over to a rival search engine. This is so because using the Google search engine means that there is a high chance users will be indoctrinated into the GOOG ecosystem (E.g. Gmail, Google Drive, etc.).

***For monetizing advertisers,***

1. GOOG is one of the largest platforms that advertisers can advertise on. The type of information that users receive is dependent on GOOG, GOOG controls the information flow to consumers and hence is a powerful platform for advertisers to advertise on.

Apart from these factors, GOOG has begun targeting SMBs (Small and Midsize Businesses).

How GOOG sees SMBs (Small, Medium Businesses) advertising with them is that GOOG will provide Gen AI to generate images/captions for their ad campaign then SMBs use these advertising materials and advertise on Search.

When forecasting advertising revenue, opting for less granularity, and due to a lack of public data, I lumped both search and YouTube together. Taking the number of YouTube users as a proxy for the popularity of GOOG’s advertising tools.

So, I assumed that it would take 1 year for GOOG to finish and get Gemini up to speed. I assumed that it takes about 2 years for consumers to get used to Gemini and for advertisers to notice this shift. This quick adaptation is because ChatGPT took off very quickly within the year it was released.

When forecasting revenue/users, due to the macro constraints and pessimism advertisers are cautious about advertising so the revenue/users have been dropping for the past 2 years. I assume it takes 2 years for the macro outlook to improve and during the high growth period, revenue/users grow as well as more advertisers start spending more.

&#x200B;

When forecasting Google Subscriptions + Others, which entails YouTube premium, GOOG devices, and Google Play revenue. I assumed that the success of this category is based on YouTube Premium so I forecasted this revenue segment based on the number of subscribers to YouTube Premium. Number of Subscribers in 2022 ([SOURCE](https://www.billboard.com/business/streaming/youtube-music-premium-subscribers-how-many-1235594920/#:~:text=That's%20up%20from%20the%2080,at%20the%20end%20of%202021)). Comparing Youtube Music to its strongest competitor Spotify, Spotify has a large switching cost due to years worth of playlists built that would be lost by switching over. On top of that, having to learn the new UI of YouTube Music and the lack of certain features that Spotify users are used to.So, the main driver for this segment would be YouTube Premium, given the indispensable nature of YouTube due to the strong network effect and new frontiers such as YouTube Shorts that are driving people to YouTube, and the longer unskippable ads, all these factors are driving people to subscribe to YouTube Premium. However, I’m cautious about how much or how fast YouTube Premium will grow. Due to strong competitors such as TikTok and Spotify, I’d assume the historic large growth will taper downwards as the high historic growth was due to the low-hanging fruits being picked.

&#x200B;

When forecasting Revenue/Users, as GOOG wants to keep their prices low to attract users to YouTube Premium, historically the revenue/users have been declining. However, as recently as July 2023 GOOG started hiking prices. So, I’d assume that in my forecast from FY24 onwards, the Revenue/Users begin rising.  Historic price hikes have been at around 16%, I’d assume that GOOG no longer pursues such aggressive price rises and begins tapering down their price increases. Their perpetual Revenue/users growing in line with the perpetual inflation rate.

&#x200B;

When forecasting Google Cloud revenue, since there isn’t available relevant data to create a bottoms-up revenue model I forecasted it as Y/Y growth. Taking into account ([SOURCE](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/cloud-computing-industry)). Given that GOOG mainly offers IAAS and SAAS for cloud computing, as businesses begin ramping up their digital efforts in line with the global push towards digitalization there is an increasing demand for IAAS and SAAS cloud computing, especially for IAAS which is stated to have the highest growth rate. I assumed that GOOG’s cloud revenue grew at a Y/Y CAGR of 19.3%.

# Cost:

When forecasting COGS, TAC accounted for about 40% of COGS as per 2023 10-K. I assumed that TAC would tend slightly upwards due to the competition for traffic increasing from competitors such as TikTok.

When forecasting R&D and marketing, opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of historic averages.

When forecasting G&A, management has stated that there is a potential usage of AI to reduce the need for labor. I’d assume that G&A tends downward slightly.

# WACC:

RFR (1M Avg) = 4.14%

Beta ([SOURCE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG/)) = 1.06

Conclusion:

Ultimately, in my base case, I value GOOG at $143.16 per share. I believe that GOOG is a company with strong growth potential. However, given that GOOG is a household name and especially with the recent hype when they announced gemini it has led to a lot of enthusiasm and bullish outlook that caused their prices to temporarily spike upwards.

Analysis:  
  
Amazon's recent strategic adjustments are poised to enhance its profitability significantly through the expansion of the Amazon Global Logistics Program and modifications to its Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) policies. Here's a breakdown of why these changes will benefit Amazon financially:  
  
Expansion of Amazon Global Logistics Program:- What it is: Amazon Global Logistics is a comprehensive shipping and logistics service that facilitates international shipping for sellers on Amazon's platform. It handles cargo from the point of origin to Amazon warehouses worldwide, including sea, air, and land transportation.  
  
\- Impact: Given that 60-70% of Amazon's third-party sellers are from China, and a substantial portion of private label goods on Amazon are imported from China, the expansion of this program positions Amazon as a key logistics provider for international sellers. By handling sea shipping directly, Amazon eliminates the need to pay third-party shipping companies, thus capturing more revenue from the logistics and shipping process.

\- What it is: Amazon's policy now encourages third-party FBA sellers to use its Amazon Warehouse Distribution system, compelling them to store inventory in Amazon's warehouses, which incurs storage fees, inbound fees, and other charges. Amazon will then automatically distribute its inventory to FBA warehouses as it deem fit.  
  
\- Impact: This move ensures a consistent revenue stream from storage and handling fees paid by sellers. Additionally, sellers are faced with significant penalties for not using AWD, such as high inventory placement fees or the logistical burden of distributing inventory across multiple locations in the USA. (Before this, sellers can usually send all its inventory to one warehouse to save on cost, but that's no longer the case). This strategy not only generates more revenue from fees but also reduces Amazon's costs by shifting the inventory distribution burden to sellers. The average inventory placement cost per box will be about $25-$50. This is absolutely ridiculous.  
  
Implementation of Extra Fulfillment Fees for Low Inventory:  
  
\- What it is: Amazon has introduced an additional fulfillment fee for sellers who maintain less than 28 days of inventory in Amazon's warehouses. This fee, a minimum of $0.89 per unit, penalizes sellers for not keeping a sufficient stock, especially for high-demand items.  
  
\- Impact: This policy directly impacts sellers' profit margins, especially for those selling products at lower price points. For example, a $9.99 item with a profit margin of $2, selling 10,000 units a month, this extra charge significantly eats into profits. The intent behind keeping inventory levels lean—to avoid excessive storage fees—now results in additional costs through fulfillment fees.  
  
This policy effectively forces sellers to either risk running low on inventory and incurring extra fees or overstock to avoid these penalties, leading to higher storage fees. What's even more fucked up about it is that Amazon fulfillment centers usually checks in our shipments late. This means that if I have shipment that was delivered to Amazon Warehouse (Say enough inventory to cover 40 days) but not checked in, and I only have 30 days of inventory left, now I will have to pay extra fee because of ""low inventory"" even though it takes forever for Amazon to process your inventory. I have multiple shipments that's been delivered for about 3 weeks now, and they are still not checked in.  
  
\- Strategic Benefit for Amazon: By charging extra for fulfillment when inventory levels fall below a certain threshold, Amazon not only generates additional revenue but also pressures sellers to maintain higher inventory levels, thereby increasing the use of Amazon's storage facilities. This policy, combined with the ""voluntary"" use of Amazon's Inventory Placement service for restocking, which incurs additional fees, further ties sellers into Amazon's logistics ecosystem. It incentivizes the use of Amazon's AWD system, underlining Amazon's strategy to centralize control over logistics and distribution, enhancing its revenue streams from logistical and warehousing services while also potentially reducing operational complexities and costs.  
  
\*\*Overall Financial Impact:\*\*These backend changes significantly reduce operational costs for Amazon by streamlining logistics and warehouse operations. Simultaneously, they increase revenue through logistics services, storage, and handling fees. By centralizing control over logistics and storage, Amazon not only saves on the costs of dealing with external logistics providers but also capitalizes on the fees charged to sellers. This dual approach of cutting costs and boosting revenue streams is poised to enhance Amazon's profitability in the competitive e-commerce and logistics sectors.  
  
Again, I hope Lina Khan investigates the shit out of Amazon for using this bullshit tactic, but it is what it is. This is going to be extremely bullish for Amazon as it cuts costs while strengthen its global logistics empire.  
  
Bonus: Amazon Advertising is also a bunch of bullshit (In terms of as a gigantic cash cow for them). The suggested bids for keywords are usually 2x higher than the actual bid needed to get top spots. This makes uninformed sellers spend a crap on advertising everyday. Just for perspective, I have about 12 products in my private label brand, and I spend on average $300-$500 a day. YES EVERY SINGLE DAY. That's about $110k to $190k a year just in ads. This is extremely high margin business for Amazon because they don't have to do anything. In addition, by Amazon running Ads on most prime video accounts, they will make on average $10/month per user. They also signed deals with NFL to exclusively stream their games. As much as I hate them, the future for Amazon is only up.  
  
Extra bonus: Amazon already handles majority of packages in the US. By a click of a button, they can easily start taking marketshare from both UPS and Fedex by offering shipping to everyday people. They can utilize their wholefoods or kohl's location to receive and ship packages. Or they could also offer franchise opportunities to mom-pop shipping/packaging stores just like how UPS and Fedex has it.

# Introduction:

TSLA is the world's most renowned Electric Vehicle(EV) automaker, catalyzing the world's acceleration towards Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) Vehicles. TSLA has become the gold standard for what a high-quality EV stands for, all thanks in part to their founder's vision and belief in renewable energy especially during the tumultuous early years of TSLA. TSLA no longer just stands for EV but renewable energy, having branched out into Energy Storage, and Solar Panels.  TSLA hopes to create an ecosystem for renewable energy from charging to energy storage to the vehicle used, all this tied together by dedicated software created by TSLA at every point of contact in the ecosystem. This ecosystem business model has seen massive success as evident from businesses like GOOG, AAPL, and MSFT. I believe the next frontier of growth for TSLA comes from energy storage rather than automotive, however automotive will still account for the largest chunk of revenue for TSLA.

# Market:

TSLA's closest EV competitor is BYD. TSLA has won BYD on almost every front. A country where BYD has managed to wrest control from TSLA is Thailand. So I'll analyze this market specifically to rationalize why I believe this victory will be shortlived.

In Thailand, the top 3 most popular car models are BYD Atto 3, Netta V, and BYD Dolphin ([SOURCE](https://carnewschina.com/2024/01/09/byd-is-bestselling-ev-brand-in-thailand-in-2023-neta-is-runner-up/)).   

|Model|Price|Range|
|:-|:-|:-|
|BYD Atto 3|1.1M Baht|521 km/charge|
|Neta V|0.55M Baht|380 km/charge|
|BYD Dolphin|0.75M Baht|427 km/charge|
|Tesla Model 3|1.59M Baht|513 km/charge|

In Thailand, 60.17% of the population owns a car ([SOURCE](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1027960/thailand-car-ownership-among-consumers/)) with the average car price being about 0.78M Baht. This means that a Tesla Model 3, TSLA's cheapest model is double the average price of a normal car in Thailand. 

[SOURCE](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1030220/thailand-average-monthly-income-per-household-by-region/)) which means that the Tesla Model 3 is a luxury good rather than an affordable commodity for the average household. The difference in price between BYD and Tesla is a full year's worth of income for the average household which leads the price-conscious consumers in Thailand to naturally gravitate towards BYD, hence the popularity of BYD over Tesla in Thailand.   
  
Ultimately, I do believe that if TSLA continues competing on quality and finds ways to cut costs such as directly setting up factories in Thailand ([SOURCE](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/03/05/business/thailand-tesla-factory-talks-intl-hnk/index.html)), it will be able to close the price gap with BYD. As ""people are really stretching their wallets to be able to afford a Tesla. It’s quite a difficult thing for them to do, and remarkable that it’s the best-selling car in unit volume, despite being much more expensive than other high-volume cars.” - 2023 Q4 Earnings Conference

# Revenue:

TSLA has 5 revenue channels, namely “Automotive Sales”, “Services and Others”, “Automotive Lease”, “Automotive Regulatory Credit” and “Energy Generation and Storage sales”. 

***Automotive Sales***

Automotive sales refers to the direct sale of TSLA’s vehicles fully paid upfront.

Elon Musk believes that manufacturing capabilities will be the most important C.A. for TSLA. “perhaps the most important competitive characteristic of Tesla in the future will be manufacturing technology” -  2023 Q4 Earnings Conference. 

When forecasting the Number of Vehicles each Gigafactory can produce, I took into account that Elon Musk recently unveiled in the 2023 Q4 Earnings conference that there is a new revolutionary manufacturing technology that is expected to drastically improve production. He hopes to pilot test this technology at the Texas Gigafactory to produce their low-cost EV before proceeding to replicate the technology in every Gigafactory. “the sensible way to go about things is kind of figure out the core technology of the manufacturing line and then replicate it with improvements throughout the world.” -  2023 Q4 Earnings Conference. So, in my first 3 years, I assume that the growth rate is below historical averages as TSLA tests out new technology in preparation for the launch of the low-cost EV. I assumed that TSLA’s manufacturing technology was successful.  
  
When forecasting %Vehicles delivered, opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of historical averages  
  
When forecasting Avg Price/Vehicles Delivered, Elon Musk doesn’t believe in price increases to increase the topline. As evident in 2021 and 2022 where Elon Musk only increased prices due to supply chain constraints before bringing prices back down in 2023. In China, Elon Musk ended up cutting prices due to being able to source significantly cheaper batteries there. I assumed that over time as TSLA enjoys sufficient economies of scale, they will only increase prices in line with perpetual inflation.  


***Services and Others***

TSLA provides a few services such as home servicing in certain regions or customers pay to access TSLA’s network of SuperChargers.  
  
Lifetime number of TSLA automobile (Ex roadster) delivered ([SOURCE](https://backlinko.com/tesla-stats))

Assuming that TSLA is properly maintained they can last \~20 years ([SOURCE](https://caredge.com/blog/how-long-tesla-batteries-last)). Opting for less granularity, in my forecast I assumed the total lifetime number of tesla cars remained constant without any churn.

When forecasting Services and Others, Opting for less granularity I assumed that the servicing’s pricing grew following the price of the vehicle in line with historic averages. 

  
***Automotive Lease***

TSLA has 2 types of lease, “Direct Vehicle Operations Lease” which leases out vehicles to customers for up to 48 months afterwards the vehicle is returned to TSLA. “Direct Sales Lease” either granting the customer title of the vehicle once full payment has been made or the customer has the option of refusing the vehicle.  
  
When forecasting Automotive leasing, as prices for TSLA fell in 2023, Automotive leasing as a percentage of Automotive Sales dropped as it is now cheaper for customers to purchase their tesla in 1 lump sum payment. I assumed that following this trend, as TSLA’s affordability increases over time the %Automotive Sales decreases as well before remaining constant in perpetuity.

  
***Automotive Regulatory Credit***

TSLA has excess carbon credit which it sells to competitors.

“It will continue for some period of time, but eventually this stream of regulatory credits will reduce.” ([SOURCE](https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-9-billion-revenue-selling-regulatory-credits-to-other-carmakers-2024-2)).  


When forecasting Automotive Regulatory Credit, given that TSLA does not intend to depend on these credits for revenue, I assume that as a %of Automotive sales, credit will contribute to a significantly lesser amount in perpetuity. This is further exacerbated by other automobile companies accelerating their push towards EVs as countries begin phasing out ICE vehicles. So, more companies begin having excess regulatory credits as well. Ultimately, I believe that leading up to 2030 the amount of revenue contributed by Regulatory credits decreases to a significant level. 

  
***Energy Generation and Storage Sales***

TSLA produces Energy Storage systems e.g. Megapack and Solar Energy related products e.g. Solar Panels which it directly sells to customers.  
  
For energy storage more specifically megapacks, as the world phases out ICE vehicles and begins embracing renewable energy, it leads to a surge in demand for electricity. However, the issue with renewable energy is that “The most common renewable energy sources like the sun and wind are intermittent or have lower baseload capabilities than coal, natural gas, or nuclear sources. This makes it necessary to have a way to conserve excess energy produced during peak hours. This extra energy can then be supplied through the grid or otherwise when the sun is down, or wind speed reduces.” ([SOURCE](https://www.batterycycle.io/why-is-tesla-focusing-on-the-battery-energy-storage-market/)). As an example to elaborate on how much importance is placed on energy storage, China mandates that all renewable energy facilities must store at least 20% of their total output ([SOURCE](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiYquPrkuaEAxXuSGwGHffzBkgQFnoECA0QAw&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Ferikkobayashisolomon%2F2023%2F12%2F20%2Fenergy-vault-wins-big-with-gravity-storage-in-china%2F%23%3A~%3Atext%3DChina%2520has%2520mandated%2520that%2520all%2Cgeneration%2520capacity%27s%2520worth%2520of%2520storage.&usg=AOvVaw3WMq0w9-2ka0Cz2kAGbCWX&opi=89978449)).  
  
The closest competitor to TSLA in energy pack is BYD. The TSLA’s megapack is smaller in dimensions compared to BYD and on top of that TSLA has built its own software to be compatible with the megapack hardware with features such as Autobidder (Software to optimize energy trading) and Powerhub.  
  
Right now what's stopping revenue for energy storage is production capacity, TSLA opened its megapack factory in Lathrop to curb this. TSLA has also announced its plans to build a megapack factory in China to assist with production capacity ([SOURCE](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-22/tesla-acquires-land-for-shanghai-megapack-battery-factory)). As an overarching goal for my forecast, I took into account the TSLA master plan 3.  
  
When forecasting number of dedicated megapack factories opened, I assumed that TSLA would open 1 additional plant every 3 years for the next 10 years, to meet the large surge in demand as countries accelerate their push towards renewable energy.  
  
When forecasting Max Output/Factory, taking into account this article on expected output. ([SOURCE](https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2023/11/tesla-megapack-factory-production-limit-solved-and-capacity-will-be-doubled-to-80-gwh.html)). TSLA’s Lathrop Megapack factory can produce 80GWh/Year in part due to them doubling their existing lines and resolving certain issues. Over time I believe that TSLA can massively increase the Max Output/Factory, as TSLA consistently touts their innovations as having an S curve of progression, where progress is slower at the earlier stages before exponentially increasing.   
As a sanity check, in my base case assuming that all Mega packs are still at 4 MWh. TSLA has to produce 406,200 Mega Packs or 81,240 Mega Pack per factory a year by 2038. As of November 2023, the Lathrop factory can produce 20,000 megapack. So, in 15 years I believe it is a reasonable amount of time necessary for TSLA to ramp up their production 4x.  
  
When forecasting %GWh Deployed, I had to assume total output which is a function of max output and the number of gigafatories. I assumed that over the years as more countries begin phasing out ICE vehicles in favor of EVs, there is a larger need to deploy more energy storage so this % increases to a large extent.  
  
When forecasting Avg Sales/GWh Deployed, Elon Musk does not like to increase sales through increasing pricing which was why when TSLA enjoyed economies of scale from increasing output in their Lathrop factory the Avg Sales/GWh Deployed decreased. So, applying this principle of TSLA slashing prices when costs decrease due to economies of scale, I assumed that TSLA continued slashing prices before increasing by the perpetual inflation rate.

# Cost:

“predicting auto gross margins is extremely challenging since there are many moving parts to this equation, some of which are out of our control like the change in tariffs or local incentives to name a few. While the teams are focused on cost reductions, we are approaching the limits within our current platforms.” - 2023 Q4 Earnings Conference. 

  
When forecasting Automotive and Non-Automtoive COGS, COGS as a %revenue for 2021 and 2022 are likely to be lower due to TSLA pre-emptively increasing sales price to deal with inflation. However, in 2023 COGS as a %revenue increased as TSLA cut back on sales price. Going forward, I’ll assume that TSLA tends towards historic pre-covid average. However, in the long run, as TSLA successfully implements their manufacturing technology this % will decrease even further.  
When forecasting R&D, SG&A, and Others, opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of historic averages.

Currently, TSLA has a very large beta as its stock has increased in volatility in the past few years. However, I believe that this volatility will not persist for very long as most big tech stocks enter a stable stage where their beta tends downwards. So, as a proxy for how low TSLA’s beta will tend to, I looked at other big tech stocks.



|Name|Beta|
|:-|:-|
|Google (GOOG)|1.04|
|Microsoft (MSFT)|0.89|
|Meta (META)|1.21|

Taking the average beta, we arrive at a beta of 1.05. Assuming similar D/E composition and bond rating. I assumed that it took another 10 years for TSLA to reach the stable state.  
  
Stable State COE = 8.95%  
Stable State AT-COD = 4.52%  
TSLA’s stable stage WACC = 8.90%  


# Conclusion:

Ultimately in my base case, I value TSLA at $186.88 per share. I believe that there is still room for TSLA to grow, having such a strong first movers advantage in the renewable energy market means that TSLA is heads and shoulders above its competitors. I believe that the market is undervaluing the Energy Storage arm of TSLA's business, and less emphasis is placed on this potentially disruptive segment of business.

AMZN,Amazon (AMZN) DCF Analysis,25,18,1711025569,"***NOTE NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE***

Before I start, I should preface by saying that I understand that AMZN is a good stock in general, my post will not be on why AMZN is good. But beyond that, I'd also like to explore whether or not AMZN is over/undervalued, it is possible to be a good stock but still overvalued. 

# Introduction:

AMZN has built a strong business model, creating a global logistics network to connect consumers to sellers all over the world. This behemoth of a business inadvertently makes AMZN irreplaceable in our day-to-day life, the convenience and speed at which AMZN offers its services is unparalleled by many companies. Because the company takes a long-term view on returns, it chooses to forfeit short-term gains for longer-term returns. On top of its logistics business, AMZN is also involved in cloud computing the next frontier with large growth potential, all these show the forward-thinking acumen its leaders have.

# Investment Thesis:

***Established Logistics Network***  
AMZN’s most compelling competitive advantage is that it has an established global logistics network that no other company can replicate without substantial monetary and time investment, through controlling its own logistics network by purchasing its own cargo ships and leasing planes ([SOURCE](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/04/how-amazon-beats-supply-chain-chaos-with-ships-and-long-haul-planes.html)). AMZN can control where the ship docks which allows them to be more efficient with their cost through avoiding busy ports.   
  
***Strong Reverse Logistics***  
Consumers increasingly perceive easy & free returns as essential ([SOURCE](https://www.powerreviews.com/research/reduce-returns/)). A very large C.A. for AMZN is its established reverse logistics as evidenced by AMZN being able to offer free return shipping for such a large volume of goods due to them expanding the scale of their reverse logistics that it makes economical sense for them to be able to offer these services for free. AMZN has also increased the ease of returning products, for example, by using UPS stores as a physical retail location where customers can drop off their parcels. UPS is reliant on AMZN as well, accounting for 11% of UPS revenue which gives AMZN large leverage over UPS ([SOURCE](https://www.wsj.com/business/fedex-amazon-discuss-returns-4325af30?st=oo1tomj716vco8d&reflink=article_copyURL_share))  
  
How retailers manage their reverse logistics is also important as it is an additional outlet of significant revenue source. A few notable strides that AMZN is taking in this front is FBA Grade and Sell, where AMZN grades the item that buyers returned and grades it. Afterward, 3P Sellers (FBA Sellers) set the price based on the condition of the product.   
  
***Branding Goodwill***  
Even though in recent years a few large e-commerce platforms have appeared such as Taobao, Shoppee, and Alibaba. AMZN has managed to maintain its reputation as a place that consumers will turn to if they want to get high-quality, safe, and reliable products that would not be flimsy or poorly made. The main reason why people use Taobao or Alibaba is because it is a website to get quasi items at a fraction of the price ([SOURCE](https://ec4ulimited.com/advantages-disadvantages-taobao-shopping/#:~:text=Goods%20from%20Taobao%20are%20cheap,for%20same%20or%20similar%20items)). Consumers have grown to accept the compromise in quality in exchange for a discount, this may be great in an economic downturn but during an average or booming macro environment, it ends up becoming a disadvantage. On top of that, by competing on price Taobao and Alibaba in the long run is unable to earn much margins and reinvest substantially to grow their business at a pace comparable to AMZN.

# Revenue:

***Retail Sales***  
Retail sales refer to AMZN’s online marketplace and physical stores.   
AMZN has such large economies of scale that they can offer higher quality products for cheaper. “Amazon prices are 13% cheaper than other retailers for essential items.” ([SOURCE](https://www.grocerygazette.co.uk/2022/11/16/amazon-prices-cheaper-retailer/#:~:text=Amazon%20prices%2013%25%20cheaper%20than%20other%20retailers%20for%20essential%20items,-FMCGNewsSupermarkets&text=Amazon%20prices%20are%20an%20average,a%20new%20study%20has%20revealed)). On top of that, the increasing convenience of AMZN through speedier delivery increases the appeal of AMZN. “more than 90 percent of consumers expect two- to three-day delivery as the norm, while 30 percent expect same-day delivery.” ([SOURCE](https://www.jpmorgan.com/solutions/treasury-payments/insights/why-shopping-has-changed-forever)).   
AMZN can achieve higher rates of same-day delivery due to their strategy called “regionalization”, where they store items closer to customers. This results in customers choosing AMZN to deliver their everyday shopping needs as AMZN can get them their items significantly faster. Regionalization also allows AMZN to save on cost which in turn allows AMZN to offer a wider variety of items at a lower Average Selling Price (ASP) profitably. On top of that, AMZN has also released RUFUS an interactive AI model that allows the user to chat with it to get more personalized recommendations based on the consumer's diverse requirements.

  
AMZN's next frontier of growth comes from India, where it is building out a logistics network to be able to serve rural customers in India. However, AMZN has recently invested heavily in its fulfillment network by doubling it. ([SOURCE](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-doubled-fulfillment-network-since-202622130.html)) So, I assumed that AMZN would slow down growth plans to capitalize on their new fulfillment network fully. India represents a very strong growth opportunity given the high smartphone penetration rate of India, the rapid growth of the Indian economy, and their large population ([SOURCE](https://www.statista.com/statistics/467163/forecast-of-smartphone-users-in-india/)), this culmination of factors makes India a very lucrative market for AMZN to expand in.  
When forecasting Average Monthly Traffic, I took into account ([SOURCE](https://www.sellzone.com/the-state-of-amazon-2022-key-data-insights-trends-to-watch/)). I assumed that as AMZN’s fulfillment network gets more comprehensive their monthly traffic increases as AMZN’s value proposition increases. I assumed that AMZN expands its fulfillment network significantly every 5 years.  
When forecasting Sales/Monthly Traffic, as AMZN begins targeting more price-conscious countries, I assumed that AMZN’s sales/monthly traffic did not grow due to AMZN raising prices and only grew in line with the perpetual inflation rate. However, in the longer run as AMZN becomes more entrenched in these countries’ consumer habits I assumed that AMZN has larger price-setting abilities.   


***Third Party Sales (3P)***  
Third Party Sales (3P) refers to the %sales AMZN earns as commission from third party sellers that sell on AMZN’s website.   
  
The appeal of AMZN to retailers is that retailers can reach a massive audience very easily and can glean valuable insights on their products from the tools that AMZN platforms provide. Listing on AMZN also adds a layer of credibility and convenience, especially for Fulfillment By Amazon (FBA) sellers.  
  
When forecasting 3P Gross Merchandise Value, I took into account ([SOURCE](https://www.marketplacepulse.com/articles/amazon-sales-top-700-billion-in-2023)). Opting for less granularity I forecasted GMV as a % of historic averages. As AMZN expands into more markets I expect this GMV to increase as there are now more sellers that are attracted to the services provided by AMZN.  
  
When forecasting %GMV Earned, I assumed that AMZN slowly begin taking up a larger portion of the pie as AMZN would build a very strong value proposition to sellers and sellers would grow increasingly reliant on AMZN’s platform. However, I assumed modest growth as AMZN has to remain attractive to sellers by not cutting too much into their margins.

  
***Advertising***  
Advertising refers to ad revenue AMZN earns from advertisers to advertise on AMZN’s platform.  
When forecasting Advertising, there is a lack of suitable data to forecast advertising, and the success of advertising hinges on the success of retail. Opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of retail revenue.  
***Subscription***   
Subscription refers to AMZN’s subscription service, Amazon Prime.  
When forecasting number of subscribers, taking into account ([SOURCE](https://www.yaguara.co/amazon-prime-statistics/#:~:text=There%20are%20230%20million%20Amazon,through%20Prime%20membership%20in%202023)). I believe that NFLX is a very strong competitor having dedicated their entire business model exclusively to content acquisition and marketing compared to AMZN which has a lot of other businesses that they need to pay attention to. I believe a significant portion of subscribers are purchasing Prime Video as an add-on to Amazon Prime rather than just for Prime Video alone. On top of that, in foreign countries where local broadcasters are still in a strong position, it’s tougher for AMZN to break into so I believe that Amazon Prime subscribers will not grow at an aggressive pace. In the past few years, with the backdrop of a poor macro-environment AMZN’s subscribers numbers Y/Y growth rate declined evident that Amazon Prime is perceived as a luxury good or an item placed in low priority.  
When forecasting churn rate, taking into account ([SOURCE](https://churnkey.co/blog/churn-rates-for-streaming-services/)). Opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of historic averages. However, I believe that AMZN’s churn rate is higher than it should be due to the influx of new subscribers trying out Amazon Prime for the first time. So, over time I believe that as consumers get used to using Amazon Prime and develop a reliance on the service I believe that the churn rate tends downwards. So I assumed that as AMZN enters into newer markets the value of Amazon Prime increases which incentivizes consumers to stay subscribed to Amazon Prime.   
When forecasting Annual Revenue/Member, as AMZN begins targeting more price-conscious countries, I assumed that AMZN’s Annual Revenue/Member did not grow due to AMZN raising prices in these countries and only in countries where AMZN has an established presence. So, this leads to the overall Y/Y growth rate being slower in the short run.

***AWS***  
AWS refers to AMZN’s cloud computing services. AWS offers SAAS and IAAS.  
  
AWS has a strong first movers advantage, they started in 2006 whereas Google Cloud started in 2008 and Microsoft Azure started in 2010. I believe that AWS has had strong growth in recent history in part due to the chip shortage and a mass rush into AI Training that demanded a lot of chips, causing some companies to resort to renting more cloud GPUs from AMZN.  


AMZN’s Gen AI strategy has 3 layers. The first layer is targetting the training and inference market for AI. The second layer (Amazon Bedrock) offers large numbers of foundational LLM that businesses can use and develop according to their needs, allowing customers to experiment with different models to optimize experience and cost. The third layer is (Amazon Q) which functions similarly to ChatGPT.  
  
Others  
AMZN’s other revenue sources.   
  
When forecasting Others, I forecasted it as a %retail sales as the success of Others hinges on the success of AMZN’s retail arm of business. Opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of historic averages.

# Reality Check:

As a reality check for my forecast, I looked at the world’s GDP to figure out if the GMV for AMZN is in line with the total growth in goods and services in the world. As of 2023, AMZN’s GMV as a %World GDP is 0.5%. By 2040, the world GDP is at 153T ([SOURCE](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Global-GDP-could-rise-by-about-12-trillion-in-2040-an-8-percent-increase-mainly-from_fig1_346806184#:~:text=NonCommercial%204.0%20International-,Global%20GDP%20could%20rise%20by%20about%20%2412%20trillion%20in%202040,health%3A%20A%20prescription%20for%20prosperity)), I assumed that AMZN’s GMV as a %world GDP is 1.8%. This is realistic as over time, it would make sense for smaller players to sell their products on AMZN rather than rebuilding a new logistics network from the ground up. An example of smaller players using a much larger platform to sell is live stream commerce, which is prominent on platforms such as Douyin ([SOURCE](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwj8vaCGq4WFAxWO1jgGHaqNBEQQFnoECBMQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.statista.com%2Fstatistics%2F1174906%2Fchina-gmv-of-live-streaming-commerce-on-douyin%2F&usg=AOvVaw1RJ3TKxYD-m8lPZtrTMtRz&opi=89978449)).  
  
The total world population as of 2023 is at 8.05 billion ([SOURCE](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/)), and monthly Traffic as of 2023 as a % of the total world population is at 32.92%. By 2043, the world population will grow to 9.36 billion ([SOURCE](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/world-population-projections/)), I assumed that AMZN’s monthly traffic as a %world population is 49.67%.  
  
I believe that these assessments are realistic given that I am expecting AMZN to expand its logistics network about 6x over 20 years, increasing its reach far beyond its domestic reach in the US. The speed of expansion is logical too given that AMZN was able to double its logistics network 2x over 2 years. 

# Cost:

***COGS***

When forecasting COGS, Regionalization has reduced the distance needed by AMZN to deliver their item to customers, in turn saving cost.   
  
***G&A***

When forecasting G&A, I took into account the number of employees. AMZN has been reducing headcount over the past few years, as AMZN overhired during COVID-19 to keep up with the raging demand.   
  
When forecasting Cost/Employee, as AMZN is in money-saving mode I assumed that they continued the historic trend of cutting down Cost/Employee for the next 2 years before growing in line with the perpetual inflation rate.  
  
***R&D***

When forecasting R&D, R&D was capitalized. To determine the useful life I looked at what the majority of the spending was on, “Software development costs capitalized were not significant for the years presented.” and  “The weighted average remaining life of our capitalized video content is 3.5 years.” - 2023 Q4 10-K. So, I assumed that the main expenditure came from capitalized video content, and applying the conservatism principle, the amortization was rounded down to 3 years.

# Change in NWC:

When forecasting change in NWC as AMZN recently rolled out their regionalization efforts in FY23, the impact on Day Inventory may be very apparent and should be assumed as the status quo going forward.

# D&A and CapEX:

When forecasting Amortization and Content Amortization, opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of historic averages.  
  
When forecasting Content Acquisition and CapEX, I assumed that as AMZN expands its reach the CapEX spending increases before regressing to below historic averages. 

# WACC:

“The weighted-average remaining term of the financing obligations was 17.9 years and 17.0 years and the weighted-average imputed interest rate was 3.1% as of December 31, 2022 and 2023.” - 2023 Q4 10-K   
10Y T-Bond Yield (1M Avg) = 4.31%  
Beta ([SOURCE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN/)) = 1.17  
Stable Market ERP ([SOURCE](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/ctryprem.html)) = 4.60%  
COE = 9.69%  
AMZN is rated “AA-” ([SOURCE](https://www.fitchratings.com/research/corporate-finance/fitch-affirms-amazoncom-inc-at-aa-outlook-stable-20-06-2023))  
AA Bond Yield (1M Avg) = 5.03%  
Marginal Tax Rate = 21.00%  
AT-COD = 3.97%  
Stock Price (5D Avg) = $173.97  
Shares O/S = 10387.38M  
Market Value of Equity = 1807092.50M  
Weighted Average Maturity = 17.0 Years  
FY23 Debt Obligation = 67150M  
Interest Expense = 2081.65M  
Market Value of Debt = 60026.19M  
%Debt = 3.21%  
%Equity = 96.79%  
%WACC = 9.48%  


# Conclusion:

Ultimately, in my base case, I value AMZN at $155.67 per share. I believe that AMZN is still overvalued despite it being a good company. This overvaluation of AMZN is a direct result of AMZN posting high free cash flow in recent quarters which gave investors the confidence that AMZN is capable of deriving positive free cash flow from its business. However, most of this positive cash flow was derived from their high margins AWS and advertising increasing substantially Y/Y. This could mean that positive cash flows are a cyclical occurrence as cloud computing is reliant on the volatile AI market and advertising is a cyclical industry that relies on macro-conditions. I believe that there is a strong case for AMZN to break beyond its current market valuation, but for it to be successful will be dependent on how the Indian market reacts to it and if AMZN is able to restart its push in the China market.

AAPL,‘Apple is going to war’: US lawsuit adds to iPhone maker’s antitrust woes,802,315,1711224789,"A famed Apple advertising campaign exhorted customers to “think different”. In a sweeping antitrust lawsuit the US on Thursday alleged that the iPhone maker had betrayed that slogan, locking millions of its users into a powerful monopoly that has made it one of the most valuable companies in the world.  


The long-awaited lawsuit is a watershed moment for Apple. For years it was one of the few Big Tech companies to avoid major antitrust action by the US. Now it is under intense scrutiny from regulators in two of its key markets, the US and the EU. Its responses have indicated it is steeling itself for an existential battle.  


Apple said the US case “threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets”. A loss would set a “dangerous precedent” by allowing the government to influence how technology markets developed, it added.  


The new US lawsuit is broad and detailed, painting a picture of a company that has spent years knowingly heading off competitive threats to its ecosystem, be it on the App Store, in messaging with rival Android phones, on its “tap to pay” service, or in the smartwatch market.

My bet is if it’s solvable it may be decades away.

Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun said the standard version of the SU7 will sell for 215,900 yuan ($30,408) in the country — a price he acknowledged would mean the company was selling each car at a loss.

Tesla’s Model 3 starts at 245,900 yuan in China.

Lei claimed the standard version of the SU7 beat the Model 3 on more than 90% of its specifications, except on two aspects that he said it might take Xiaomi at least three to five years to catch up with Tesla on. He also said the SU7 had a minimum driving range of 700 kilometers (nearly 435 miles) versus the Model 3′s 606 kilometers. The company said orders had exceeded 50,000 cars in the 27 minutes since sales started at 10 p.m. Beijing time Thursday.

Deliveries are set to start by the end of April, Lei said. Lei also claimed that Xiaomi’s car factory, for which all “key” steps are fully automated, can produce an SU7 every 76 seconds. It was not immediately clear whether the factory was fully operational.

Earlier this week, the Xiaomi CEO said on social media the SU7 would be the best sedan “under 500,000 yuan” ($69,328).

The car is entering a fiercely competitive market in China, where companies are launching a slew of new models and cutting prices in order to survive. Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei has partnered with traditional automakers, most notably launching the Aito brand whose vehicles are often on display in Huawei smartphone showrooms.

Tesla’s Model 3 is the best-selling new energy sedan in China that has a driving range of at least 600 kilometers (372 miles) and costs less than 500,000 yuan, according to data from industry website Autohome.

BYD’s Han sedan starts at 169,800 yuan, according to Autohome.

Nio’s ET5 starts at 298,000 yuan, while Xpeng’s P7 starts at 209,900 yuan, the data showed. Geely-owned Zeekr’s 007 sedan starts at 209,900 yuan, according to Autohome.

Sales of new energy vehicles, which include battery-only powered cars, have surged in China to account for about one-third of new passenger cars sold, according to the China Passenger Car Association.

Accessories

The heads of competing electric car startups Nio, Xpeng and Li Auto were among the featured guests at the Xiaomi SU7 launch event.

Lei on Thursday showed off a range of accessories such as an in-car refrigerator, a custom front-window shade, and a smartphone holder, some available for free with a car purchase before the end of April, and others for a separate price.

The SU7 supports Apple’s Car Play and can integrate with the iPad, Lei said. He also revealed driver-assist tech for highways and cities, set to be fully available in China in August.

Tesla’s Autopilot for driver assist on highways is available in China, but the company’s “Full Self Driving” for city streets has yet to be released in the country.

Despite saying Xiaomi wanted to compete with Porsche at a car tech event in December, Lei acknowledged that the SU7 had longer to go before it might be able to compete at this more premium level. He announced that the “Max” version of the SU7, aimed as a competitor with Porsche’s Taycan, would sell for 299,900 yuan.

Ecosystem of devices

The SU7 is part of Xiaomi’s recently launched “Human x Car x Home” strategy that seeks to build an ecosystem of devices connected to its new HyperOS operating system. Most of the company’s revenue is from phones, with just under 30% coming from appliances and other consumer products.

Although Xiaomi is generally known for more affordable products, its President Lu Weibing told CNBC earlier this year the company has been pursuing a premiumization strategy since 2020 — and that there are about 20 million users in that price segment who might buy the SU7.

Lu told CNBC that the SU7 will first be sold to consumers in China, and that it would take at least two to three years for any overseas launch.

The company showed off the car at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in late February, following a reveal of the vehicle’s exterior and tech in Beijing in late December.

TSLA,"Tesla reports 386,810 deliveries in the first quarter of 2024, produced 433,371 vehicles ",1127,692,1712063430,"Tesla just published its first-quarter vehicle production and deliveries report for 2024. Here are the key numbers:

Total deliveries Q1 2024: 386,810
Total production Q1 2024: 433,371

Tesla doesn’t break out sales of its vehicles by model but reported that it produced 412,376 Model 3/Y cars and delivered 369,783 of those cars. It produced 20,995 of its other models and delivered 17,027.

In the same period last year, the electric automaker reported 422,875 deliveries and production of 440,808 vehicles. In the fourth quarter of 2023, Tesla reported 484,507 deliveries and production of 494,989 vehicles.

Deliveries are the closest approximation of sales reported by Tesla but are not precisely defined in the company’s shareholder communications.

According to a mean of 11 estimates compiled by FactSet, analysts were expecting deliveries of around 457,000 for the period ending March 31. Estimates ranged from a high of 511,000 deliveries to a low of 414,000 for the first quarter, with estimates updated in March ranging from 414,000 to 469,000 deliveries.

Independent auto industry researcher Troy Teslike, whose work is closely followed by Tesla fans, had expected deliveries to come in around 409,000.

Tesla’s head of investor relations Martin Viecha sent around a company-compiled consensus based on 30 analysts’ estimates over the weekend to select investors. The consensus, which was viewed by CNBC, said analysts were expecting a mean of 443,027 deliveries and a median of 431,125 deliveries for the quarter.

Tesla faced numerous challenges in the first quarter.

Houthi militia attacks on shippers in the Red Sea disrupted Tesla’s component supply and temporarily suspended production at its German factory outside of Berlin in January. In March, environmental activists set fire to infrastructure near that same factory, depriving Tesla of sufficient operation power and again causing a pause in production.

In China, Tesla faced an onslaught of competition from domestic EV makers, including BYD and newcomers such as the phone maker Xiaomi. After sluggish sales numbers for its China-made cars in January and February, Tesla reduced production of its Model 3 and Model Y at its Shanghai plant and slashed workers’ schedules to 5 days a week from 6 and a half days.

In the U.S., reviews were mixed for Tesla’s newest model — an angular pickup dubbed the Cybertruck — which the EV maker only began to sell in small numbers in December last year.

A series of discounts and incentives appeared to be less effective in driving sales volume than in the past for Tesla.

During the final days of the first quarter, Tesla CEO Elon Musk mandated that all sales and service staff install and demo the newest version of the company’s premium driver assistance system for customers in North America before handing over their cars. The system is marketed as Full Self-Driving but doesn’t make Tesla cars autonomous. They require a human at the wheel, ready to steer or brake at any time.

Shares of Tesla dropped 29% in the first quarter, the biggest decline since the end of 2022 and the third-steepest quarterly plunge since the company’s IPO in 2010.

TSLA,"Tesla (TSLA) PT Lowered to $115 at JPMorgan, 'We are slashing our estimates and price target'",607,314,1712197983,"
On Wednesday, JPMorgan revised its price target for Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares, reducing it to $115 from the previous $130 while maintaining an Underweight rating. The adjustment follows Tesla's first-quarter delivery numbers, which significantly fell short of both JPMorgan's and consensus expectations.

Analysts at JPMorgan expressed concern that the disappointing delivery figures might impact investor confidence in Tesla's long-term growth prospects, which is vital for upholding the stock's high valuation multiple.

Tesla's vehicle sales for the first quarter of 2024 showed a year-over-year decline of 9%, contrasting with the Bloomberg consensus estimate which anticipated a growth of 6%, and the company-compiled consensus which expected a 5% increase. This miss represents the largest discrepancy from analyst estimates on record for the electric vehicle maker.

Previously, analysts projected that Tesla would sell 626,000 vehicles in the first quarter, marking a 48% year-over-year growth, but the actual sales reported were only 387,000 vehicles, which is 38% below the peak forecast from June 10, 2022.

In light of these results, JPMorgan has also reduced its estimates for Tesla's first-quarter revenue, now expecting $21.4 billion compared to the previous $25.6 billion, and below the consensus forecast of $23.5 billion. The firm's forecast for earnings per share (EPS) for the first quarter has been lowered to $0.42 from the prior estimate of $0.69, which is also beneath the consensus of $0.61.

The revised EPS forecast is a steep drop from the peak consensus of $1.94 before Tesla implemented a strategy of heavy discounting to boost unit volume in response to softening demand.

Moreover, JPMorgan now anticipates a significant free cash outflow of $1.3 billion for the first quarter, a reversal from its earlier expectation of a $300 million inflow, and contrary to the consensus for a $1 billion inflow. This expectation is based on the assumption of a record increase in finished goods inventory, as Tesla produced 47,000 more vehicles than it sold in the quarter.

This inventory buildup, according to JPMorgan, suggests that the lower deliveries were due to demand constraints rather than supply issues, refuting any implications that disruptions such as the Houthi attacks in the Red Sea or the fire incident at Tesla's Berlin Gigafactory were the primary causes.

JPMorgan warns that Tesla shares, which already saw a 4.9% decline on Tuesday compared to the S&P 500's 0.7% drop, could face further decreases if the company fails to quickly revive unit volume and revenue growth. The firm cautions that investors might reconsider the premium valuation multiple currently assigned to Tesla's stock in the absence of sustained growth.

I do agree that they fell behind TSMC and Samsung in terms of process leadership and don't have a serious product offering in the GPU space that can take on Nvidia H100 (Gaudi 3 seems like a good competitor). And Pat Gelsinger is trying hard to bring it back on track. They have 18A process node on track to hit HVM production in 2025(?), US government is funding their fab expansion plans, Foundry is slowly winning customer, and for the next few years, compute is the new oil. Everything seems to be inline for INTC to go up like AMD and NVDA. But no, it always drops.  
  
TSLA - Eccentric owner who is more interested in peddling conspiracy theories on X that he bought on a whim. FSD was a long lost pipe dream, which never seems to be working fine , and current version has its own kinks. EV is becoming an extremely competitive market everyday with new entrants and an ongoing price war. Cybertruck was late by 2-3(?) years and has. IDK if Roadster will ever happen in this decade, Tesla Semi is another thing which seemed nice on paper but idk if it's ever really gonna happen. News reports claimed that Musk cancelled Model2. But again claims TSLA is gonna make a cheaper model ( which would probably cannibalize Model 3 and Model Y sales; and lets be honest - no one knows if and when that's actually coming on the roads).  
  
Can anyone explain why is the market so bullish about TSLA even after reporting lower EPS, 9% drop in revenue, and is ready to eat his words about the cheaper model like its God's truth itself, while INTC drops like a rock on the first opportunity, even though Semiconductors are the bedrock of AI and EV growth.",0.81,0,0.114646465,0.057323232,24-04-2024 16:58,128.5778809,84,88.51263428,235.9478455,123.1800003

MSFT,Apple announces largest-ever $110 billion share buyback as iPhone sales drop 10% ,2989,523,1714681940,"Apple reported fiscal second-quarter earnings on Thursday that were slightly higher than Wall Street expectations, but showed overall revenue down 4%, and iPhone sales falling 10%. 

Apple announced that its board had authorized $110 billion in share repurchases, the largest in the company’s history, and a 22% increase over last year’s $90 billion authorization.  

Here’s how Apple did versus LSEG consensus estimates in the March quarter: 

EPS: $1.53 vs. $1.50 estimated 

Revenue: $90.75 billion vs. $90.01 billion estimated 

iPhone revenue: $45.96 billion vs. $46.00 billion estimated 

Mac revenue: $7.5 billion vs. $6.86 billion estimated 

iPad revenue: $5.6 billion vs. $5.91billion estimated 

Other Products revenue: $7.9 billion vs. $8.08 billion estimated 

Services revenue: $23.9 billion vs. $23.27 billion estimated 

Gross margin: 46.6% vs. 46.6% estimated 

Apple did not provide formal guidance, but Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC’s Steve Kovach that overall sales would “grow low single digits” during the June quarter.  

Apple posted $81.8 billion in revenue during the year-ago June quarter and LSEG analysts were looking for a forecast of $83.23 billion.  

Apple reported $23.64 billion in net income, a 2% decrease from $24.16 billion in the year-earlier period. Overall sales fell 4% in the March quarter. 

Cook told CNBC’s Steve Kovach that year-over-year sales suffered from a difficult comparison to the year-ago period, when the company realized $5 billion in delayed iPhone 14 sales from Covid-based supply issues. 

“If you remove that $5 billion from last year’s results, we would have grown this quarter on a year-over-year basis,” Cook said. “And so that’s how we look at it internally from how the company is performing.” 

Apple said iPhone sales fell nearly 10% to $45.96 billion, suggesting weak demand for the current generation of iPhones, which were released in September. The sales were in-line with analyst estimates, and Cook said that without last year’s increased sales, iPhone revenue would have been flat.  

Mac sales were up 4% to $7.45 billion, but they are still below the segment’s high-water mark set in 2022. Cook said sales were driven by the company’s new MacBook Air models that were released with an upgraded M3 chip in March.  

Other Products, which is how Apple reports sales of its Apple Watch and AirPods headphones, was down 10% on an annual basis to $7.9 billion in revenue. 

During the quarter, Apple released its first new major product category in years, the Vision Pro virtual reality headset, but the $3500 device is expected to sell in low quantities, especially compared to Apple’s major product lines.  

“We’re only scratching the surface there so we couldn’t be more excited about our opportunity there,” Cook said. 

Apple has not released a new iPad since 2022, which is a drag on sales. Revenue for the division fell 17% to $5.6 billion. Apple is expected to announce new iPads on May 7 that could revive demand for the product line.  

Cook also said Apple has “big plans to announce” from an “AI point of view” during its iPad event next week as well as at the company’s annual developer conference in June.  

Services was a bright spot during the quarter. Sales rose 14.2% to $23.9 billion. That’s how Apple reports revenue from its subscription services, warranties, licensing deals with search engines, and payments. Apple has a broad definition of subscribers, which includes users subscribing to apps through Apple’s App Store, and said that it has over 1 billion paid subscriptions.  

Sales in Greater China, Apple’s third largest region, were off 8% to $17.8 billion in revenue, which was significantly better than the $15.25 billion in sales expected by FactSet analysts, potentially quelling investor worries that Apple may have been losing market share to local competitors such as Huawei.  

“I feel good about China, I think more about long term than to the next week or so,” Cook said. 

Cook told CNBC that iPhone sales grew in China during the quarter. “That may come as a surprise to some people,” Cook said.  

In addition to the buyback authorization, Apple said it would pay a 25 cent dividend, a one cent increase. Apple’s $110 billion buyback authorization is the largest-ever announced, ahead of Apple’s previous repurchases, according to data from Birinyi Associates.

>A landmark antitrust case pitting Google (GOOG, GOOGL) against the Justice Department entered its final stage this past week as prosecutors from the federal government and 14 states said in their closing arguments that Google illegally monopolized the online search and search advertising markets.

>A government win would certainly threaten a giant piece of Google’s $237.8 billion profit engine. But the outcome, which will be decided by US District Judge Amit Mehta in the weeks or months to come, also has giant implications for some of the other big names in the tech world.

>That's because Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) are defending themselves against a series of other federal- and state-led antitrust suits, some of which make similar claims, and because all three stand to lose or gain depending on the outcome.

>The government argues Google is violating Section 2 of the Sherman Act by blocking competitors from entering three distinct markets: general online search, search advertising, and search text advertising.

>A government win would put at risk the billions of dollars in mutually lucrative contracts between Google and Apple, as well as deals with other device manufacturers and telecom companies.

> The government alleged in its case that Google pays billions of dollars each year to LG, Motorola (MSI), and Samsung; major US wireless carriers such as AT&T (T), T-Mobile (TMUS), and Verizon (VZ); and browser developers such as Mozilla, Opera, and UCWeb.

>Government prosecutors have alleged that Google had been paying Apple an estimated $8 billion to $12 billion per year — a portion of search ad revenue — in exchange for awarding Google Search default placement on Apple devices.

**US seeks answers from Tesla in Autopilot recall probe**

[https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/us-seeks-answers-tesla-autopilot-recall-probe-2024-05-07](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/us-seeks-answers-tesla-autopilot-recall-probe-2024-05-07)

&#x200B;

*U.S. auto safety investigators are seeking detailed answers and documents from Tesla in a probe into the automaker's December recall of more than 2 million vehicles to install new Autopilot safeguards.*

*The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said last month it was investigating after receiving reports of 20 crashes involving vehicles that had the Autopilot software updates installed under Tesla's recall. The agency's letter said it had identified ""several concerns"", regarding the recall.*

*Tesla said in December its largest-ever recall covering 2.03 million U.S. vehicles - or nearly all of its vehicles on U.S. roads - was to better ensure drivers pay attention when using its advanced driver assistance system.*

*The NHTSA recall investigation covers models Y, X, S, 3 and Cybertruck vehicles in the U.S. equipped with Autopilot produced between the 2012 and 2024 model years.*

*Tesla, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment, has said repeatedly that Autopilot does not make vehicles self-driving and is intended for use with a fully attentive driver who is prepared to take over and has hands on the steering wheel.*

*NHTSA said it had sent Tesla an information request letter, which was made public on Tuesday, seeking details of the recall and documents by July 1.*

*NHTSA wants comparative data from Tesla on the performance of vehicles after receiving the recall including the number of hands on wheel warnings issued.*

*The agency said it had concerns after those 20 crashes as well as results from preliminary NHTSA tests of updated vehicles following Tesla's five-part recall remedy.*

*One issue under investigation is Tesla's recall allows drivers to set how they activate Autopilot by either allowing a single-pull or double-pull of the drive stalk.*

*NHTSA's letter said the single-pull activation of Autopilot ""is not the default setting on vehicles that received the remedy in the field"" and testing ""showed it was possible to make this change while driving.""*

*Tesla has also made additional updates to reduce crashes including high speed captive turn lane collisions that are not part of the recall.*

*NHTSA said it ""will assess the timing and driving factors behind these updates, their impacts on subject vehicle field performance, and Tesla’s basis for not including them"".*

*Last month, NHTSA said it found evidence that ""Tesla’s weak driver engagement system was not appropriate for Autopilot’s permissive operating capabilities"" and that this results in a ""critical safety gap.""*

*NHTSA said during its Autopilot safety probe launched in August 2021 that it had identified at least 13 Tesla crashes involving at least one death and many more involving serious injuries in which ""foreseeable driver misuse of the system played an apparent role.""*

*NHTSA noted Tesla's December recall ""allows a driver to readily reverse"" the software update.*

**Elon Musk proposed to launch robotaxis in China during April visit, state media report says**

[https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/china-may-support-teslas-domestic-testing-demonstration-robotaxis-says-media-2024-05-08](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/china-may-support-teslas-domestic-testing-demonstration-robotaxis-says-media-2024-05-08)

&#x200B;

*Elon Musk proposed testing Tesla's advanced driver-assistance package in China by deploying it in robotaxis, during his recent visit to the country, the state-backed China Daily newspaper reported on Wednesday, citing sources.*

*Chinese officials told the Tesla CEO that China ""welcomes Tesla to do some robotaxi tests in the country"" and hopes it can ""set a good example"", the newspaper quoted the sources as saying.*

*However, Chinese authorities did not immediately approve its widespread use of Full Self-Driving (FSD) functions, the newspaper added.*

*Before the full rollout of its FSD functions, Tesla still needs to get approval to collect and transfer data that Tesla's cars need to train its driver-assistance features. The newspaper added that this issue wasn't discussed in detail during Musk's visit.*

*A person briefed on the matter told Reuters that Tesla is seeking to apply to launch the robotaxi tests in Shanghai, where the company's largest factory globally is located.*

*Tesla and the Shanghai city government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.*

*The China Daily report comes shortly after Tesla CEO Elon Musk made a whirlwind weekend trip to Beijing late last month, where he met Chinese Premier Li Qiang.*

*Musk on the trip intended to discuss the rollout of FSD and whether Tesla could secure government approvals to transfer data overseas that could prove pivotal in its development of autonomous vehicles, Reuters previously reported.*

*FSD is the most autonomous version of Autopilot software and was rolled out in 2020. Its features include self-parking, auto lane changes and traffic navigation.*

*Among the wins during Musk's trip, which was first reported by Reuters, was a key endorsement from a top Chinese auto association that said Tesla's Model 3 and Y cars were compliant with data-security regulations. That would enable local governments to allow Tesla cars into parts of China they were previously barred from, Chinese media reported, citing a statement from Tesla.*

*Tesla has also reached an agreement with Baidu to use the Chinese tech giant's mapping license for data collection on China's public roads, according to two people who at the time described that as a step toward FSD rollout in China.*

*The China Daily newspaper, however, citing a source close to Baidu, said that the deal only meant that the accuracy of Baidu's maps provided to Tesla would be improved and that it had no direct relation with FSD.*

*Baidu did not immediately respond to a request for comment.*

*Musk has abandoned a longstanding goal for Tesla to make affordable electric cars for the masses and is looking to focus on autonomous driving software, robotaxis and its humanoid robot Optimus.*

*Last month, the company mentioned a ""purpose-built robotaxi product"" that it planned to build with a ""revolutionary"" manufacturing process, without offering a timeline for its release.*

*China has been at the forefront in the development of self-driving cars, and companies such as Baidu and Toyota-backed Pony.ai have launched robotaxi services in limited test zones in several cities.*

**In Tesla Autopilot probe, US prosecutors focus on securities, wire fraud**

&#x200B;

*U.S. prosecutors are examining whether Tesla committed securities or wire fraud by misleading investors and consumers about its electric vehicles’ self-driving capabilities, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters.*

*Tesla’s Autopilot and Full Self-Driving systems assist with steering, braking and lane changes - but are not fully autonomous. While Tesla has warned drivers to stay ready to take over driving, the Justice Department is examining other statements by Tesla and Chief Executive Elon Musk suggesting its cars can drive themselves.*

*U.S. regulators have separately investigated hundreds of crashes, including fatal ones, that have occurred in Teslas with Autopilot engaged, resulting in a mass recall by the automaker.*

*Reuters exclusively reported the U.S. criminal investigation into Tesla in October 2022, and is now the first to report the specific criminal liability federal prosecutors are examining.*

*Investigators are exploring whether Tesla committed wire fraud, which involves deception in interstate communications, by misleading consumers about its driver-assistance systems, the sources said. They are also examining whether Tesla committed securities fraud by deceiving investors, two of the sources said.*

*The Securities and Exchange Commission is also investigating Tesla’s representations about driver-assistance systems to investors, one of the people said. The SEC declined to comment.*

*Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. Last October, it disclosed in a filing that the Justice Department had asked the company for information about Autopilot and Full Self-Driving.*

*The Justice Department declined to comment.*

*The probe, which is not evidence of wrongdoing, could result in criminal charges, civil sanctions, or no action. Prosecutors are far from deciding how to proceed, one of the sources said, in part because they are sifting through voluminous documents Tesla provided in response to subpoenas.*

*Reuters could not determine the specific statements prosecutors are reviewing as potentially illegal. Musk has aggressively touted the prowess of Tesla’s driver-assistance technology for nearly a decade.*

*Tesla videos demonstrating the technology that remain archived on its website say: “The person in the driver’s seat is only there for legal reasons. He is not doing anything. The car is driving itself.”*

*A Tesla engineer testified in 2022 in a lawsuit over a fatal crash involving Autopilot that one of the videos, posted in October 2016, intended to show the technology’s potential and did not accurately portray its capabilities at the time. Musk nevertheless posted the video on social media, writing: “Tesla drives itself (no human input at all) thru urban streets to highway streets, then finds a parking spot.”*

*In a conference call with reporters in 2016, Musk described Autopilot as “probably better” than a human driver. During an October 2022 call, Musk addressed a forthcoming FSD upgrade he said would allow customers to travel “to your work, your friend’s house, to the grocery store without you touching the wheel.”*

*Musk is increasingly focused on self-driving technology as Tesla's car sales and profit slump. Tesla recently slashed costs through mass layoffs and shelved plans for a long-awaited $25,000 model that had been expected to drive sales growth.*

*“Going balls to the wall for autonomy is a blindingly obvious move,” the billionaire executive posted on his social-media platform X in mid-April. Tesla shares, down more than 28% so far this year, surged in late April when Musk visited China and made progress toward approvals to sell FSD there.*

*Musk has repeatedly promised self-driving Teslas for about a decade. ""Mere failure to realize a long-term, aspirational goal is not fraud,"" Tesla lawyers said in a 2022 court filing.*

*LEGAL CHALLENGES*

*Prosecutors scrutinizing Tesla’s autonomous-car claims are proceeding with caution, recognizing the legal hurdles they face, the people familiar with the inquiry said.*

*They will need to demonstrate that Tesla’s claims crossed a line from legal salesmanship to material and knowingly false statements that unlawfully harmed consumers or investors, three legal experts uninvolved in the probe told Reuters.*

*U.S. courts previously have ruled that “puffery” or “corporate optimism” regarding product claims do not amount to fraud. In 2008, a federal appeals court ruled that statements of corporate optimism alone do not demonstrate that a company official intentionally misled investors.*

*Justice Department officials will likely seek internal Tesla communications as evidence that Musk or others knew they were making false statements, said Daniel Richman, a Columbia Law School professor and former federal prosecutor. That is a challenge, Richman said, but the safety risk involved in overselling self-driving systems also “speaks to the seriousness with which prosecutors, a judge and jury would take the statements.”*

*FATAL CRASHES*

*Tesla’s claims about Autopilot and FSD have also drawn scrutiny in regulatory investigations and lawsuits.*

*Safety regulators and courts have raised concerns in recent months that corporate messaging about the technology - including the brand names Autopilot and Full Self-Driving - have imbued customers with a false sense of security.*

*In April, the Washington State Patrol arrested a man on suspicion of vehicular homicide after his Tesla, with Autopilot engaged, struck and killed a motorcyclist while the driver looked at his phone, police records show. In a probable-cause statement, a trooper cited the driver’s “admitted inattention to driving, while on autopilot mode ... putting trust in the machine to drive for him.”*

*In Washington state, a driver remains ""responsible for the safe and legal operation of that vehicle"" regardless of its technological capabilities, a state patrol spokesperson told Reuters.*

*The same month, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration launched an investigation into whether a Tesla recall of more than 2 million vehicles in December adequately addressed safety issues with Autopilot.*

*NHTSA declined to comment.*

*The recall followed a long-running probe opened by regulators after cars with Autopilot engaged repeatedly crashed into vehicles at first-responder emergency scenes. Regulators subsequently examined hundreds of crashes where Autopilot was engaged and identified 14 deaths and 54 injuries.*

*Tesla disputed NHTSA's findings but agreed to the recall, which employed over-the-air software updates intended to alert inattentive drivers.*

*The NHTSA investigation found “a critical safety gap between drivers’ expectations” of Tesla’s technology “and the system’s true capabilities,” according to agency records. “This gap led to foreseeable misuse and avoidable crashes.”*",0.73,0,0.065744296,0.032872148,08-05-2024 09:11,128.5778809,84,88.51263428,235.9478455,123.1800003

AAPL,Moving on from AAPL,0,65,1716558605,"So, I had an excellent ride on AAPL for a good long bit, but bit a bit Meh on it concerning it's YTD performance , and what I see as a lot of lackluster reviews of it's recent product offerings and choices.  Thinner ipad, who cares?  New chip, no software yet to take advantage of it probably for the better part of a year.  Virt Reality, no killer app to drive it.  AI, they seem to be late in their development, although Apple has always been the greatest at their catchup/surpassing game.  I think there maybe better options for me, looking for a sounding board.  Still looking to keep it in steadily plodding behemoths for ease of mind, but something better than flat YTD performance i got out of apple this year.

First up MSFT, up 14% YTD, has a wide moat, seems to be well positioned for AI, although their gaming sector is looking kinda soft to me.  Like their latest offerings in pc with infused AI, and tablet.

Next up AMZN, up 21% YTD, also a wide moat, with a lot of stability in their supplied items and businesses.  Nothing really lights up the sky, just plodding along.  I think they have an AI strength used in their background business, but has an appearance of hiding, as it has no consumer face to it.

Lastly NVDA, up 110% YTD.  They are definitely the star of the moment, and I think there is still gas in this tank, but being a hardware vendor mostly with some software driven solutions for AI for their platform alone, they may have locked up a good lead that will only grow.

So searched about this I found that it was due to ""stock split"". From what I understood about this, is basically increasing the number of available stocks but keeping the proportion of what the company is worth. Meaning if before I had 10 stocks at 500, now I'll have 20 stocks at 250. I get that part, but I couldn't figure why this is done, what does the company gains by doing this.

AAPL,Nvidia briefly passes Apple as second most valuable public U.S. company,572,154,1717617690,"[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/05/nvidia-passes-apple-in-market-cap.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/05/nvidia-passes-apple-in-market-cap.html)

[Nvidia](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/) briefly passed [Apple](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL/) in market cap on Wednesday during intraday trading as the chipmaker emerges as the primary beneficiary of the [artificial intelligence](https://www.cnbc.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/) boom. If it holds until the close, it will be the second most valuable U.S. company.

Nvidia hit a [$3 trillion market cap](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/05/nvidia-briefly-passes-3-trillion-market-cap-on-back-of-ai-boom.html) milestone during intraday trading. Nvidia had a market value of $3.007 trillion at one point, versus Apple’s, which stood at $3.005 trillion.

Nvidia shares have risen over 24% since the company [reported first-quarter earnings](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/22/nvidia-nvda-earnings-report-q1-2025-.html) in May and have been on a tear since last year. The company has an estimated 80% market share in AI chips for data centers, on which big tech companies spend billions.

Investors are also becoming more comfortable that Nvidia’s huge growth in sales to a handful of cloud companies can persist. For the most recent quarter, its data center business, which includes its GPU sales, rose 427% in a year to $22.6 billion in sales, about 86% of the company’s overall revenue.

Meanwhile, Apple shares are only about 5% this year, as Apple’s sales growth has stalled in recent months. In its most recent quarterly earnings report, Apple said overall sales dropped 4% and iPhone sales fell 10% from the year-ago period. Apple faces strategic questions and issues about demand in China, manufacturing, and mixed reactions to its new virtual reality headset, Vision Pro.

Apple was the first company to reach $1 trillion and $2 trillion market caps. It has frequently been the most valuable U.S. company over the past few years but was again [passed by Microsoft](https://www.reuters.com/technology/microsoft-overtakes-apple-worlds-most-valuable-company-2024-01-11/) earlier this year. Microsoft has benefitted from the same investor demand for AI as Nvidia.

Nvidia’s stock has been more volatile than Apple. Founded in 1991, it was primarily a gaming company, selling hardware to play 3D computer games. More recently it has sold cryptocurrency mining chips and cloud subscription services.

Nvidia shares have gone parabolic as its AI business has developed, rising over 3,290% in the past five years.

As it stands, Tesla has a total shares outstanding of 3.189 Billion. Something along those lines.

AAPL,Apple's (AAPL) Rollercoaster: Should You Jump In Now?,194,79,1717975081,"If you’ve been keeping an eye on Apple (AAPL), you know it’s been a wild ride lately. The stock took a beating in the first four months of 2024, dropping 8% while the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index climbed 6%. Why? Stagnant growth and a DOJ lawsuit knocked investor confidence. But then May came along, and Apple bounced back with a 12% surge thanks to strong Q2 results for fiscal 2024, announced on May 2.

**Quick Stats**

* **Current Price:** $196.89 (+1.24%)
* **Market Cap:** $3,019B
* **52-Week Range:** $164.07 - $199.62
* **Volume:** 53M (Avg: 60M)

**What's Driving the Turnaround?**

Apple’s revenue for Q2 2024 dipped 4% year-over-year to $90.8 billion, mainly because iPhone sales fell to $46 billion from $51.3 billion last year. But here’s the kicker: Apple’s earnings per share nudged up to $1.53, beating the $1.50 expectation. The services sector is where Apple shone, raking in a record $23.9 billion, up 14% year-over-year. This area is a goldmine for Apple, bolstering its bottom line even when hardware sales lag.

Looking ahead, Apple expects revenue to pick up in the current quarter, driven by services and a bounce back in iPad sales. Given that iPhones contribute to half of Apple’s revenue, any uptick in smartphone sales will be a big win. The global smartphone market is on a comeback, with 7.8% growth in Q1 2024, according to IDC, and AI-enabled smartphones could be a game changer this year.

**AI: The Next Big Catalyst**

Apple’s rumored to be diving into the AI smartphone market with iOS 18. Features like AI-powered transcripts, message summaries, and even a smarter Siri could debut soon. AI enhancements are expected to drive another upgrade cycle, and with Apple holding a 17% share in the smartphone market, this could be huge.

**Should You Buy In?**

Analysts are bullish. Wedbush Securities sees Apple’s AI-enabled iPhones kicking off a major upgrade cycle, upping their price target to $275 from $250—a potential 45% gain from current levels. The median 12-month price target is $202, suggesting a 6% upside.

Here’s the play: Apple’s trading at 29 times trailing earnings, which is a discount compared to the Nasdaq-100’s 31 times. With analysts revising their earnings expectations upwards and AI developments on the horizon, this might be the moment to get in before Apple starts another run.

**Action Plan:**

1. **Buy Zone:** Under $195, if you’re looking for a solid entry.
2. **Sell Targets:** Short-term around $202; long-term riding the wave towards $275.
3. **Watch List:** Keep an eye on AI updates and quarterly earnings for quick reaction opportunities.

MSFT,Riding the MSFT Rocket ,0,18,1718072943,"Riding the MSFT Rocket 🚀 

Alright, here’s 2 cents on MSFT 

**Current Play** 

MSFT is hanging out at $427.87, flirting just below its recent peak of $433.60. The 50-day moving average is chillin' at $414.55, while the 200-day is holding down at $395.67. Volume’s spiking, and you know what that means someone's loading up heavy! 

**Analyst Chatter** 

**Analysts are bullish on Microsoft:** 

* Goldman Sachs reaffirmed their “buy” rating with a target of $460. 
* Morgan Stanley is rating it “overweight,” targeting $450. 
* JP Morgan set a $455 target, taking a neutral stance. 
* Barclays raised their target to $470, maintaining a “buy.” 
* Credit Suisse is holding steady with a $445 target. 

Overall, 30 out of 35 analysts recommend a “buy,” with an average target around $460. The general sentiment is bullish, focusing on Microsoft’s advancements in AI and cloud computing. 

**Financial Pulse** 

**Microsoft’s financials are rock solid:** 

* Earnings Per Share came in at $11.01, beating expectations. 
* Revenue: $56.2 billion, up 11.3% year-over-year. Big boy numbers. 

**Key ratios to note:** 

* Debt-to-Equity Ratio: 0.40. 
* Profit Margin: 33%. 
* Return on Equity: 35%. 

These figures highlight Microsoft’s robust growth and profitability. 

**Insider Moves** 

**There’s been some notable insider trading:** 

* Satya Nadella, CEO, sold 59,907 shares in May, likely cashing in on gains. 
* Amy Hood, CFO, sold 20,000 shares. Total insider sales have reached about $40 million in the past quarter. 

Despite these sales, insiders still hold significant shares, signaling continued confidence. 

Institutional Maneuvers 

**Big institutional players are bullish:** 

* BlackRock added 1.2 million shares. 
* Vanguard Group increased their stake significantly. 
* Renaissance Technologies boosted their position by 5%. 
* T. Rowe Price now holds $6.5 billion worth of MSFT shares. 

These moves show strong institutional confidence in Microsoft’s future. 

**Major News and Tech Developments** 

**Several key developments are pushing Microsoft forward:** 

**AI and Cloud Expansion:** Microsoft is aggressively expanding its AI and cloud capabilities. They’ve introduced Copilot, an AI-driven tool within Microsoft 365, which automates routine tasks and provides advanced analytics. This tool is expected to enhance user productivity significantly. 

**OpenAI Partnership**: Their deepening partnership with OpenAI is a major catalyst. Integrating advanced AI models from OpenAI into Azure positions Microsoft as a leader in AI-as-a-service. They’ve also launched ChatGPT Enterprise, offering secure and scalable AI solutions for businesses. 

**Quantum Computing:** Microsoft’s investment in quantum computing through Azure Quantum is promising. This technology is expected to tackle complex problems more efficiently than classical computing, potentially revolutionizing fields like logistics, cryptography, and pharmaceuticals. 

**AI Hardware Advances:** Microsoft is working on a custom AI chip, Athena, to enhance AI applications’ performance across their cloud infrastructure. This should reduce reliance on third-party chips and lower costs. 

**Cloud Services Growth:** Azure’s growth continues, driven by new enterprise customers and expanded services in data analytics and cybersecurity. Microsoft’s cloud services are pivotal for the digital transformation of businesses worldwide. 

# Apple’s Flop

Apple just had an epic fail, folks. Their AI event was a total disaster, and it’s got people rethinking their game plan. Here’s the tea:

* **Lackluster AI Unveil:** Apple tried to flex their new AI features, but it was a major letdown. They barely brought anything new to the table. The crowd reaction was like, “Seriously, Apple? That’s it?”
* **Tech Flops:** The live demo was a nightmare. Siri couldn’t handle basic commands without lagging or outright failing. Imagine trying to show off your new tech, and it glitches right in front of everyone. Cringe city.
* **Market Reaction:** Investors weren’t having it. Apple’s stock took a 3% dive today as people dumped shares faster than you can say “AI fail.” Wall Street’s questioning whether Apple can even hang in the AI race now.
* **Missed Opportunities:** Apple didn’t announce any major AI collaborations or breakthroughs, leaving the impression that they’re playing catch-up instead of leading the charge.
* **Consumer Backlash:** Social media is roasting Apple’s presentation, with memes and complaints about how underwhelming it was. Not the kind of viral you want.

Looks like Microsoft is poised to steal the AI crown while Apple scrambles to get their act together. With MSFT’s solid AI strategy and Apple tripping over their own feet, this is a prime time to bet on Microsoft pulling ahead.

**My Strategy** 

**Technical Setup:** 

* 50-Day Moving Average: $414.55. 
* 200-Day Moving Average: $395.67. 

**Entry Points:** 

* Short-Term: I’m looking to enter around $420.00, which aligns with support and offers a solid risk/reward ratio. 
* Long-Term: If it drops to the 50-day MA at $414.55 or below, it’s a strong buy for long-term holding. 

**Exit Strategy:** 

* Short-Term Gains: I’m targeting an exit around $460.00, in line with average analyst targets. 
* Long-Term Hold: I’m aiming for a higher exit around $470.00, which aligns with Barclays’ more bullish target. 

**Risk Management:** 

* Monitor Financial News: I’ll keep an eye on AI and cloud computing updates and any new tech releases. 
* Adjust Stops: I’ll raise the stop-loss level as the stock price rises to protect gains. 

**The Bottom Line** 

Microsoft’s push into AI, cloud computing, and quantum computing, combined with strategic partnerships and new tech developments, positions it well for growth. With entry points around $420.00 and exit targets between $460.00 and $470.00, MSFT looks set for solid gains.

MSFT,Is AMD actually a stock to hold for 10-20 years?,113,175,1718342147,"I have a broad portfolio and have been holding AMD since around $14.

I now need to liquidate a considerable part of my portfolio for financial reasons. Only a part of the portfolio will remain. The question is whether AMD should be one of the select 4-5 stocks to hold for the long term, say 10-20 years - next to VUAA which will remain the major chunk of my portfolio.

What are your thoughts on this - is AMD really a hold for the long term? Or should I take my gains and begone with it?

Just for info: my other ""Hold"" stocks are MSFT, AAPL, MCD and maybe 1-2 others.

EDIT: wow, thanks for all the answers so far, there were some amazing replies, truly appreciate it! Also makes me very uplifted and optimistic that not everyone is as obstructive as some ... But I guess every group has to have a few of those right?

Before you downvote, no I don’t mean what are you buying 1 week calls on. 

I mean outside of ETF’s and mutual funds, do you have a particular stock that over the next 5-10 years you are hyper bullish on, believing it’s the next “big thing”. 

No, this isn’t me lazily asking Redditors to do DD for me. 90% of my account is invested in ETF’s with the remaining 10% in one stock that I plan to hold until at least 2030. (No I won’t say it here, I don’t want this to sound like a thinly veiled plug and no it’s not *that* stock).

Thats why i find it ironic his stock is the last to rally and it should be the mother of all come backs.

List of things going for TSLA into the second half of the year.

-pay package approved, now incorporated in TX, a massive hurdle out of the way

-Optimus robot. Wouldn't be surprised if there was a Iron man suit in the works (probably a top secret project?)

-License approved to test FSD is China

-FSD 12.4.1 release soon.

-Robo taxi announcement less than two month away(August 8th). RIP $Uber

-Model 3 Long Range now qualifies for the $7,500 tax credit. This will boost $ales.

-GM, Toyota, Honda and Ford cutting their production on EV's gives Telsa the opportunity to take more market share. More Tesla's on the road? More Robo taxi'$ to operate. More people using robo taxi, no need to buy a car from GM or Ford or Toyota.

-Master Plan Part 4 (Release date TBD)

-New products in the pipeline. They will certainly bring back the $25K car.

-Europe imposed a massive tarriff on Chinese made EV's. Good for Telsa.

-USA tariff on Chinese cars? 100%!!! , no competition from china here.

-Expansion in India is certain, just a matter of when.

The big short: Tesla is one of the most shorted stock in the market(Dollar Volume Sold Short$18.04 billion) with 1.1 days to cover. Tesla has been know to have massive +$30-$40 days, the faster shorts cover the faster we go to $280, my PT.

TSLA reminds me of Apple a few months ago trading at low $170's with not much excitement, now its near $220.

I have TSLA $205 call for July 26, i fully expect TSLA to reach the moon before the Robo taxi release. The time may be running out to get cheap calls.

TSLA,NVDA after stock split won’t be like TSLA,0,14,1718673227,"
Whether NVDA is overvalued or not is up for debate, I have been hearing on Youtube that NVDA will drop after stock split just like TSLA did.  Let’s look into some figures for comparison:

regarding NVDA, the current market capitalization as of June 2024 is around $3T. This valuation makes NVIDIA one of the most valuable companies in the world by market cap, even higher than the peak valuation of over $1 trillion for TSLA.

In October 2021, TSLA PE ratio was quite high, reflecting its growth expectations and market enthusiasm. The PE ratio was around 250.96 at the end of September 20211, and it likely remained in a similar range throughout October. The forward PE ratio, which is based on projected earnings, was also elevated, indicative of the optimism about the company's future performance.

As for NVIDIA, as of today, the current PE ratio is approximately 77.182. The forward PE ratio, which considers expected future earnings, is around 46.823 (TSLA at its peak:67.57). These values suggest that investors are expecting strong growth from NVIDIA as well.",0.41,0,0.070277778,0.035138889,18-06-2024 01:13,128.5778809,84,88.51263428,235.9478455,123.1800003
GOOG,Getting on the AI bandwagon,35,70,1718735028,"Hello Everyone, I am already invested in the SP500 through Vanguard (of which AI giants like Nvidia and Google form a major part).

Alternately, I am also thinking about buying more affordable but promising AI companies (I wouldn't know which) using the philosophy that a rising tide lifts all boats. Or maybe an AI-based sector ETF?

I have never invested in individual stocks before (other than what was granted to me through RSUs) and am not even sure if a play like this makes sense.

Is what I am contemplating prudent? Any feedback (critical or otherwise) is welcome.

EDIT: Thanks for the very spirited discussion and the comments.

Everything below this line was written before the release of P&D numbers \~

&#x200B;

TSLA is going to release its 2024Q2 P&D numbers in the next couple of hours, WS analysts think that total delivery could reach 438,019 (vs 466,140, i.e. around 6% YoY drop).

In my opinion, 438K is still far too high based on continuous checking shared by a lot of non-WS analysts - which is supported by the data regularly released in Mainland China, Europe and the United States. The educated estimates should be ranging from 415K to 420K, implying at least 9% YoY decline.

Recall in January 2024's investor call that Mr. CEO was saying TSLA is between two major growth waves while no further guidance was provided (very tricky to be honest), does it mean ""low growth"" or actually ""no growth""?

More information will be followed post the release of 2024Q2 numbers ...

*Tesla's June-quarter deliveries likely fell 6%, the first time the top EV maker is set to post two straight quarters of decline, as it deals with stiff competition in China and slow demand due to a lack of affordable new models.*

*The company is expected to deliver 438,019 vehicles for the April to June period, according to an average estimate based on forecasts from 12 analysts polled by LSEG, seven of whom slashed their expectations in the past three months. The EV maker is expected to announce the results on Tuesday.*

TSLA,"Tesla reports 443,956 deliveries in second quarter, a 4.8% decrease from last year ",997,423,1719926973,"Tesla just posted its second-quarter vehicle production and deliveries numbers for 2024.

Here are the key numbers:

Total deliveries Q2 2024: 443,956 vehicles

Total production Q2 2024: 410,831 vehicles

Tesla’s numbers beat Wall Street estimates. Analysts expected Tesla deliveries to hit 439,000 in the three months ending June 30, according to a consensus of estimates compiled by FactSet Street Account. The total number of deliveries in the second quarter was down 4.8% from 466,140 a year earlier.

Troy Teslike, an independent researcher widely followed by Tesla fans, predicted deliveries of 423,000 for the quarter.

Deliveries are the closest approximation of sales disclosed by the electric vehicle maker. Tesla groups deliveries into two categories — Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, and all other vehicles — but doesn’t report numbers for individual models or specific regions.

Tesla’s current lineup includes its popular Model Y crossover utility vehicles, Model 3 sedans and the new Cybertruck pickups, as well as the Model X SUV and flagship Model S sedan.

In April, Tesla reported a drop of 8.5% in first-quarter deliveries to 386,810, the first annual decline since 2020. Weeks later the company reported 13% decline in year-over-year revenue for the quarter, “primarily due to lower average selling price.”

Sluggish sales were in part the result of temporary factory shut downs initiated in response to an alleged arson attack at Tesla’s factory in Germany, as well as shipping delays following Red Sea conflicts, Tesla said.

But the sales drop also correlated with Tesla’s aging lineup of vehicles, increased competition from other EV makers especially in China, and brand erosion that one recent survey attributed partly to CEO Elon Musk’s “antics” and “political rants.”

Tesla shares are down 16% in 2024 even after rallying 6% on Monday.

Tesla has offered a range of discounts and other incentives this year to try spur sales.

In China, Tesla is currently offering a zero-interest loan as an incentive to get customers to buy a Model 3 or Model Y by July 31. According to its 2023 annual filing, Tesla generated about $21.75 billion of its overall revenue from China, representing 22.5% of total sales.

Colin Langan, an analyst at Wells Fargo, issued a report on Monday, saying the firm sees “declining delivery growth driven by lower demand & diminished return on price cuts.” He recommends selling Tesla shares.

Wells Fargo expects automotive gross margins at Tesla, not including environmental credits, to fall given the “likelihood of more price cuts & lower volumes” as the year continues.

Investor focus will now shift to Tesla’s second-quarter earnings report later this month, and a separate marketing event planned for August, when the company intends to reveal its design for a dedicated robotaxi or “CyberCab.”

ETA: My husband did not force me or get into my account, I trusted him because he handles our finances. This is not to shame him. He has a very high earning career he should focus on that which has provided us money and also some sound real estate we purchased over a decade ago...  but he has no experience in markets or finances so he should not be picking stocks and should just buy into a long term growth strategy like an index fund. I feel like we can do much better than the current situation with our stock portfolios. I want him to do the same to his accounts. Basically cut down on these mistakes and losses and move in an upward direction. Unfortunately these were some costly mistakes but better to learn now than not at all right?

Based on their current AI stack im not sure they will be able to beat the current expectations in a big way consistently. MSFT is not NVDA. NVDA chips cost $30k+ each, as much as a low end Tesla. Copilot has a free version and the pro version is $20-$30 per user. Most people at companies are not using this and im not sure this will add to the bottom line very much. That means most of the earnings growth will have to come from the cloud business, admittedly the cloud business has been growing at double digits for a long time but there is also a lot of competition in cloud space, at some point growth will slow as cap ex spending slows. The other thing to consider is what AI costs for these companies. The GPU's are expensive, Data storage is expensive and the energy demand from AI use is very very expensive. At some point AI use, especially from free users is going to eat into the profit margins.

MSFT right now is like buying a over priced Cadillac, yeah it drives nice but its overpriced.

AAPL is also overvalued at 35x earnings. Adding chatGPT to a smartphone and enhancing siri isn't worth the current valuation. The goggles were a bust. No new products on the horizon just same stuff just newer versions. Apple isn't the glamorous high growth tech company it once was. Iphones sales are falling off in China and this will definitely show in the next couple quarters of earnings. Its the Nike of tech stocks.

That fourth industrial revolution is not happening today or tomorrow, we are too early. This is going to take some time.

I agree with Ken Griffin on this, the current AI products on the market are not the revolution many are hoping for, they're mediocre at best.

They are the biggest player in cloud serving. AWS (Amazon Web Services) is the backbone for many companies. Look at Netflix: it would take them 3+ years to transition out of using AWS, so they probably won’t do that. Amazon can up their charges to these companies, much like how Apple can within the App Store. And the bigger these companies get, the more money Amazon makes.

Amazon is a diversified company. When I buy an Amazon share, I am buying a technology, entertainment, and retail business. So to see it as one uniform business doesn’t make much sense.

They are investing so much into AI infrastructure that they could potentially be one of the most benefited companies from AI. 

Their PE ratio instills doubt into a lot of investors; on paper it looks like an expensive company currently. However, the reason why that is, is because they underreport earnings. They reinvest so much into their business, and this expense hurts net income, thus high PE. However, they will gradually report more and more net income and the E in PE will look a lot better. Now is the time to buy, when investors are discouraged by the high PE. Just buy now and hold for 20 years.

GOOG,"Morgan Stanley names Apple as a ""top pick"" for AI efforts, raises price target from $216 to $273 ($4.2T market cap)",356,133,1721052838,"(Reuters) -Apple's shares rose 2.5% to a record high on Monday after Morgan Stanley raised its price target on the iPhone maker's shares and designated the stock as a ""top pick,"" citing the company's AI efforts as a boost to device sales.

In what was seen as a move to catch up with Alphabet's Google and Microsoft-backed OpenAI, the iPad maker last month unveiled Apple Intelligence, luring customers to upgrade their devices to be able to use the new technology.

Apple's shares, which have jumped nearly 20% this year, rose to $236.30, giving the company a market value of $3.62 trillion, the highest in the world.

""Apple Intelligence is a clear catalyst to boost iPhone and iPad shipments,"" Morgan Stanley analysts said.

The new technology is compatible with only 8% of iPhone and iPad devices and Apple has 1.3 billion units of smartphones currently in use by customers, the analysts said, adding that the company could sell nearly 500 million iPhones over the next two years.

Morgan Stanley, which previously expected Apple to sell between 230 million and 235 million iPhones annually over the next two years, raised its price target on the company's shares to $273 from $216.

The stock has an average rating of ""buy"" with a median price target of $217, and has outperformed the S&P 500 index this year, according to LSEG data.

Industry analysts expect Samsung and Apple to lead the charge in global smartphone market recovery this year given the buzz around GenAI-enabled smartphones.

Apple sold 45.2 million smartphones globally in the three months ending June, up from 44.5 million a year earlier, but its market share fell to 15.8% from 16.6% in the same period, according to IDC data.",0.93,0.5,0.127748918,0.313874459,15-07-2024 14:13,128.5778809,84,88.51263428,235.9478455,123.1800003

MSFT,Microsoft shares drop as cloud miss overshadows better-than-expected revenue,680,208,1722370089,"Microsoft shares fell 7% in extended trading on Tuesday after the software company reported disappointing cloud revenue, overshadowing stronger earnings and revenue than analysts had predicted.

Here’s how the company did, compared with the LSEG consensus:

Earnings per share: $2.95 vs. $2.93 expected

Revenue: $64.73 billion vs. $64.39 billion expected

Microsoft’s revenue increased 15% year over year in the fiscal fourth quarter, which ended on June 30, according to a statement. Net income, at $22.04 billion, was up from $20.08 billion, or $2.69 per share, in the year-ago quarter.

Revenue from Azure and other cloud services grew 29% during the quarter. Analysts polled by CNBC and StreetAccount had expected 31% growth. Microsoft doesn’t disclose revenue from the category in dollars. Last week Google parent Alphabet said revenue from its cloud business, encompassing Workspace productivity software and Google Cloud Platform infrastructure, went up by about 29%. 

During the fiscal fourth quarter, Microsoft started selling Surface PCs with AI features that can run certain models locally without the need for an internet connection. Dell, HP and other device makers also touted their own so-called Copilot+ PCs. CEO Satya Nadella said at a press briefing in May that “we’re bringing real joy and a sense of wonder back to creation on the PC.”

GOOG,Bloomberg: US Considers a Rare Antitrust Move: Breaking Up Google,3311,597,1723582995,"A rare bid to break up Alphabet Inc.’s Google is one of the options being considered by the Justice Department after a landmark court ruling found that the company monopolized the online search market, according to people with knowledge of the deliberations.

The move would be Washington’s first push to dismantle a company for illegal monopolization since unsuccessful efforts to break up Microsoft Corp. two decades ago. Less severe options include forcing Google to share more data with competitors and measures to prevent it from gaining an unfair advantage in AI products, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private conversations.

Regardless, the government will likely seek a ban on the type of exclusive contracts that were at the center of its case against Google. If the Justice Department pushes ahead with a breakup plan, the most likely units for divestment are the Android operating system and Google’s web browser Chrome, said the people. Officials are also looking at trying to force a possible sale of AdWords, the platform the company uses to sell text advertising, one of the people said.

The Justice Department discussions have intensified in the wake of Judge Amit Mehta’s Aug. 5 ruling that Google illegally monopolized the markets of online search and search text ads. Google has said it will appeal that decision, but Mehta has ordered both sides to begin plans for the second phase of the case, which will involve the government’s proposals for restoring competition, including a possible breakup request.

Alphabet shares fell as much as 2.5% to $160.11 in after-hours trading before erasing some losses.

A Google spokesman declined to comment on the possible remedy. A Justice Department spokeswoman also declined to comment.

The US plan will need to be accepted by Mehta, who would direct the company to comply. A forced breakup of Google would be the biggest of a US company since AT&T was dismantled in the 1980s.

Justice Department attorneys, who have been consulting with companies affected by Google’s practices, have raised concerns in their discussions that the company’s search dominance gives it advantages in developing artificial intelligence technology, the people said. As part of a remedy, the government might seek to stop the company from forcing websites to allow their content to be used for some of Google’s AI products in order to appear in search results.

**Breakup**

Divesting the Android operating system, used on about 2.5 billion devices worldwide, is one of the remedies that’s been most frequently discussed by Justice Department attorneys, according to the people. In his decision, Mehta found that Google requires device makers to sign agreements to gain access to its apps like Gmail and the Google Play Store.

Those agreements also require that Google’s search widget and Chrome browser be installed on devices in such a way they can’t be deleted, effectively preventing other search engines from competing, he found.

Mehta’s decision follows a verdict by a California jury in December that found the company monopolized Android app distribution. A judge in that case hasn’t yet decided on relief. The Federal Trade Commission, which also enforces antitrust laws, filed a brief in that case this week and said in a statement that Google shouldn’t be allowed “to reap the rewards of illegal monopolization.”

Google paid as much as $26 billion to companies to make its search engine the default on devices and in web browsers, with $20 billion of that going to Apple Inc.

Mehta’s ruling also found Google monopolized the advertisements that appear at the top of a search results page to draw users to websites, known as search text ads. Those are sold via Google Ads, which was rebranded from AdWords in 2018 and offers marketers a way to run ads against certain search keywords related to their business. About two-thirds of Google’s total revenue comes from search ads, amounting to more than $100 billion in 2020, according to testimony from last year’s trial.

If the Justice Department doesn’t call for Google to sell off AdWords, it could ask for interoperability requirements that would make it work seamlessly on other search engines, the people said.

**Data Access**

Another option would require Google to divest or license its data to rivals, such as Microsoft’s Bing or DuckDuckGo. Mehta’s ruling found that Google’s contracts ensure not only that its search engine gets the most user data – 16 times as much as its next closest competitor — but that data stream also keeps its rivals from improving their search results and competing effectively.

Europe’s recently enacted digital gatekeeper rules imposed a similar requirement that Google make available some of its data to third-party search engines. The company has said publicly that sharing data can pose user privacy concerns, so it only makes available information on searches that meet certain thresholds.

Requiring monopolists to allow rivals to have some access to technology has been a remedy in previous cases. In the Justice Department’s first case against AT&T in 1956, the company was required to provide royalty-free licenses to its patents.

In the antitrust case against Microsoft, the settlement required the Redmond, Washington, tech giant to make some of its so-called application programming interfaces, or APIs, available to third-parties for free. APIs are used to ensure that software programs can effectively communicate and exchange data with each other.

**AI Products**

For years, websites have allowed Google’s web crawler access to ensure they appear in the company’s search results. But more recently some of that data has been used to help Google develop its AI.

Last fall, Google created a tool to allow websites to block scraping for AI, after companies complained. But that opt-out doesn’t apply to everything. In May, Google announced that some searches will now come with “AI Overviews,” narrative responses that spare people the task of clicking through various links. The AI-powered panel appears underneath queries, presenting summarized information drawn from Google search results from across the web.

Google doesn’t allow website publishers to opt-out of appearing in AI Overviews, since those are a “feature” of search, not a separate product. Websites can block Google from using snippets, but that applies to both search and the AI Overviews.

While AI Overviews only appear on a fraction of searches, the feature’s roll-out has been rocky after some excerpts offered embarrassing suggestions, like advising people to eat rocks or to put glue on pizza.

GOOG,GOOG - Bull Case - Custom TPU leading to successful AI products,51,49,1723637688,"I've been experimenting text based GPT from OpenAI's ChatGPT to Google Bard to now Gemini AI.

Since late '22 when the world was caught in attention on the magic of ChatGPT, people have been flocking to buy the next best accelerator cards (Nvidia), hoping they can be the next one to come out with the killer app - that ambitious goal to reach AGI first.

It's only up until very recently that I was made known that Gemini AI is entirely trained on Google custom TPU. I read a little about it (I found that TPU discussion is very little over here) and found that in the earlier days since Alexnet deep learning approach back to 2012.

Previous generalized computing (thank you Intel Xeon) tries to cope with big data workload. Accelerators were found to be particularly efficient in those machine learning workload. Early exploration by Google on designing custom TPU for themselves so they can have more flexibility catering to specific workloads. This decision alone turns out to be very valuable in today's Gen AI era.

With recent news from Apple that they have been training their AI models with Google's TPU, also the performance of Gemini AI to be on par with industry leading ChatGPT (heard that Antropic's Sonnet is even better - but Gemini is really good enough for my daily use).

These observations make strong statements to the Gen AI community, i.e.,  you can bypass Nvidia and still perform adequately well (even supercede for some reports) in your AI product offering.

The fact that Google does not hoard all its computing power to its own Gemini training, and the ability to extend its compute to customers like AAPL speak volume on the native TPU effectiveness.

Cost and time wise, Google is the prime candidate in AI era as TPU helps smoothen out the training cost. With ads revenue fueling the AI training (heard that OpenAI now needs more money), and superior TPU working natively, I'm of the opinion that Google will create a lot of value many years from now.",0.79,0.75,0.198154762,0.474077381,14-08-2024 12:14,128.5778809,84,88.51263428,235.9478455,123.1800003

I'm sharing this old idea I had more than a decade ago. I bought AAPL around 2012. Then for several years, I would look daily at it's stock price. One day i noticed that if I bought AAPL at 9am ET on Monday morning then sell at 9.30am ET, I could possibly make a profit, at least on days where the market would not be doom and gloomy.
Doing it daily and compounding the profits, I'd end up possibly rich, at least based on a quick calculation I did in either 2014 or 2015  with a subset of data ranging forabout a quarter length...

That's it, easy right, little risk, hence a possible arbitrage:
Buy AAPL at 9 on Monday, sell it at 9.30.

But I never executed the idea as I didn't want to get into the active trading thing.
Fast forward now in 2024, I'm wondering if it  was a great idea?
I don't have access to my Bloomberg anymore and don't have time to run numbers. Maybe it's an old well known idea among traders and I'm not the first one who thought about it. 
Maybe it's still a valid trade, maybe there are other stocks who would enjoy the Monday morning effect or kick.
I have no idea.
But I wanted to share it here to all the experts to get some insights.

AMZN,Amazon passed Google as 4th largest in S&P 500,583,165,1726007610,"“Amazon stock was rising on Tuesday, just enough to maintain its place as the S&P 500’s fourth-largest company by market value after overtaking Alphabet on Monday. It may owe Oracle a little bit of a thank you.

Shares of Amazon.com were up 2.6% at 2:09 p.m. on Monday, after rising 2.3% on Monday. With Monday’s move, Amazon passed Alphabet as the fourth-largest company in the U.S. for the first time since April 5. Alphabet’s stock has fallen 8.7% in September, while Amazon is off just 0.7%. Amazon’s market cap was $22 billion more than Alphabet’s at Monday’s close, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

Amazon had some good news for investors at an investor conference, noting that its cloud business, AWS, is gaining further traction in AI but that it’s also focused on “balancing expenditures with revenue growth,” according to BofA analyst Justin Post.

There was also good news from Oracle’s earnings. Yes, most of the good news was for Oracle stock, which has risen 12% on Thursday. But with the release of its earnings, Oracle and AWS said that they had come together with a new cloud product, Oracle Database@AWS. Oracle already has partnerships with Microsoft’s Azure and Google, but Post notes that the AWS/Oracle deal should be good for both companies. “Oracle & AMZN had been competitive for database customers, so new partnership suggests companies have a lot to gain by working together,” he writes.

Right now investors will just settle for gains.”

GOOG,"Nike CEO John Donahoe is out, replaced by Elliott Hill ",425,76,1726777535,"Nike on Thursday announced that its CEO John Donahoe is stepping down and longtime company veteran Elliott Hill will take the helm of the sneaker giant.

Donahoe, who has been Nike’s CEO since Jan. 2020, will retire from his position on Oct. 13. He will stay on as an advisor through the end of January. Hill is slated to take over on the following day.

“I am excited to welcome Elliott back to NIKE. Given our needs for the future, the past performance of the business, and after conducting a thoughtful succession process, the Board concluded it was clear Elliott’s global expertise, leadership style, and deep understanding of our industry and partners, paired with his passion for sport, our brands, products, consumers, athletes, and employees, make him the right person to lead Nike’s next stage of growth,” said Mark Parker, Nike’s Executive Chairman. “Personally, I have worked with Elliott for more than 30 years and I look forward to supporting him and his senior management team as they seize the opportunities ahead.”

Nike is in the midst of a broader restructuring effort after its shifted its strategy to sell directly to consumers. Critics say in the process of building out sales at Nike’s stores and website, it lost sight of innovation and failed to churn out the types of sneakers the company was known for.

GOOG,'Safety Disaster:' Tesla FSD 'Galaxies Away From Being Anywhere Close To Competition',263,184,1727431479,"* Tesla's FSD, which is now promoted as fully-supervised, is now the core technology behind the robotaxi service the company plans to launch.
* Most analysts assign hefty value for the FSD technology alone.

  
With just two weeks to go for Tesla, Inc.’s TSLA Robotaxi unveil event, an analyst painted a bleak picture of the company’s self-driving technology.



**What Happened**: Tesla’s FSD, which is now promoted as fully-supervised FSD, is a “safety disaster” and “galaxies away from being anywhere close to the competition,” said GLJ Research’s Gordon Johnson in a note. Tesla’s competitors in this arena are Alphabet, Inc.’s GOOGL GOOG Waymo and General Motors Corp.’s GM Cruise.



With Tesla eyeing the rollout of its Fully Supervised FSD in China, the Elon Musk-led company would be up against domestic player Baidu, Inc.’s BIDU Apollo Go.



Johnson referenced reviews by two sources to make his case. Independent lab AMCI Testing, which tried the technology, said the overall performance of Tesla’s camera-enabled autonomous-driving software is “suspect.” In a report released on Tuesday, the firm said its evaluation showed how often human intervention was required for safe operation. “In fact, our drivers had to intervene over 75 times during the evaluation; an average of once every 13 miles,” it said.



While the FSD 12.5.1 was impressive, it is incredibly dangerous for drivers operating with FSD to drive with their hands in their laps or away from the steering wheels, it said. “The most critical moments of FSD miscalculation are split-second events that even professional drivers, operating with a test mindset, must focus on catching,” it added.



Johnson also referred to data from [Teslafsdtracker.com](http://Teslafsdtracker.com), which aggregates TSLA FSD driving experiences/data, in real-time from users, which shows that the latest iteration of FSD has a **critical disengagement every 130 miles and every 72 miles when driven in a city.**

  
Data reported by competitors to the California Department of Motor Vehicles show that miles to disengagement data for various players are as follows:

* Waymo: 17,311 miles
* **Amazon, Inc.’s** AMZN Zoox: 177,602 miles
* [Pony.Ai](http://Pony.Ai) (startup): 17,077 miles
* WeRide (startup): 21,191 miles

The **metric for Tesla is 13 miles**, based on AMCI’s statistics, Johnson said, although Tesla doesn’t yet report data to California DMV, given its FSD tech is **only Level 2.**  


**Why It’s Important:** Johnson noted that many sell-side analysts assign a valuation of $300 billion to $600 billion for Tesla’s FSD technology. In real-time, the value is close to zero, he said, adding that it could be negative, given the “liability of putting something this dangerous on roads.”

  
According to Ark’s valuation model, by 2029, robotaxis, which has FSD as its core technology, would account for 63% of Tesla’s revenue and 86% of EBITDA.

Future Fund LLC Managing Partner Gary Black, a Tesla bull, said in a recent post on X that Tesla's FSD is not yet close to the 99.99% efficacy needed for unsupervised autonomy.



In premarket trading on Thursday, Tesla rose 2.05% to $262.30

Tesla shares drop 6% in premarket after Cybercab robotaxi reveal fails to impress",1707,565,1728649167,"Shares of electric vehicle maker Tesla tumbled Friday after the company’s long-awaited robotaxi event — where CEO Elon Musk unveiled the firm’s Cybercab self-driving concept car — failed to impress investors.

Tesla stock was down 5.8% as of 6:33 a.m. ET in premarket trading on Friday.

Musk revealed Tesla’s Cybercab concept vehicle — a low, silver two-seater, has no steering wheels or pedals — on Thursday night. The plan is for the car to be capable of driving itself autonomously when it launches.

The Tesla boss said the company hopes to be producing the Cybercab before 2027, but offered no details on where the cars will be manufactured. He said consumers would be able to buy a Tesla Cybercab for a price tag under $30,000.

He also said he expects Tesla to have “unsupervised FSD” up and running in Texas and California next year in the company’s Model 3 and Model Y electric vehicles. FSD, which stands for Full Self-Driving, is Tesla’s premium driver assistance system, available today in a “supervised” version for Tesla electric vehicles.

The technology still requires a human driver at the wheel, ready to steer or brake at any time.

In reaction to the Thursday event, analysts at Barclays said that the revelations had failed to highlight any near-term opportunities for Tesla, instead prioritizing Musk’s vision for a fully autonomous driving future.

“As expected, like prior Tesla product unveils, the event was light on the details, and instead emphasized the vision underpinning Tesla’s growth endeavors in AI/AV \[autonomous vehicles\],” Barclays’ U.S. autos & mobility team wrote in the note early on Friday.

“Yet there were no updates indicating near-term opportunities. Tesla didn’t show its low-cost model planned for 1H′25 production,” they added. “We also didn’t get any near-term updates on FSD progress, or data reflecting improvement in the system.”

Piper Sandler analysts said in a separate Friday note that “most trading-oriented firms will be underwhelmed by the robo-taxi unveiling.”

“We wouldn’t be surprised if the stock sells off in the coming weeks, as pre-event momentum fizzles,” the investment bank’s analysts said in the note.

Morgan Stanley, meanwhile, suggested that Musk failed to make the case that Tesla is an AI company during the event. The bank’s analysts noted that Musk didn’t mention any details on improvements to Tesla’s FSD system, nor did the billionaire go into detail regarding rumored plans of a tie-up between Tesla and xAI, Musk’s AI company. Musk has previously denied such reports.

The event “overall disappointed expectations on a number of areas: a lack of data regarding rate-of-change on FSD/tech, ride-share economics and go-to-market strategy,” Morgan Stanley’s analysts wrote in a note Friday.

“We were overall disappointed with the substance and detail of the presentation. As such, we anticipate TSLA to be under pressure following the event,” they added.

It is expected to take some years still before self-driving cars become a mainstream reality on public roads, with regulators concerned over the safety features embedded into such vehicles.

Among the few companies that have successfully launched self-driving cars on public roads is Google’s Waymo, which has offered its robotaxi service to the general public since June.",0.93,-0.5,0.01125731,-0.244371345,11-10-2024 12:19,128.5778809,84,88.51263428,235.9478455,123.1800003
GOOG,Google to buy nuclear power for AI datacentres in ‘world first’ deal,522,76,1728998805,"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/oct/15/google-buy-nuclear-power-ai-datacentres-kairos-power

Google has signed a “world first” deal to buy energy from a fleet of mini nuclear reactors to generate the power needed for the rise in use of artificial intelligence.

The US tech corporation has ordered six or seven small nuclear reactors (SMRs) from California’s Kairos Power, with the first due to be completed by 2030 and the remainder by 2035.

Google hopes the deal will provide a low-carbon solution to power datacentres, which require huge volumes of electricity.

The US company, owned by Alphabet, said nuclear provided “a clean, round-the-clock power source that can help us reliably meet electricity demands”.

The explosive growth of generative AI, as well as cloud storage, has increased tech companies’ electricity demands.

Last month, Microsoft struck a deal to take energy from Three Mile Island, activating the plant for the first time in five years. The site, in Pennsylvania, was the location of the most serious nuclear meltdown in US history, in March 1979. Amazon bought a datacentre powered by nuclear energy in March from Talen Energy.

The locations of the new plants and financial details of the agreement were not revealed. Google has agreed to buy a total of 500 megawatts of power from Kairos, which was founded in 2016 and is building a demonstration reactor in Tennessee, due to be completed in 2027.

Michael Terrell, the senior director for energy and climate at Google, said: “The grid needs new electricity sources to support AI technologies that are powering major scientific advances, improving services for businesses and customers, and driving national competitiveness and economic growth.

“This agreement helps accelerate a new technology to meet energy needs cleanly and reliably, and unlock the full potential of AI for everyone.”

GOOG,Alphabet Deserves A Better Valuation,331,166,1730394807,"**I had recommended Alphabet (GOOG)** [**as a great long-term buy at $150**](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1anr3id/alphabet_goog_150_looks_like_an_excellent_long/), several months ago.

Last evening, Google knocked it out of the park with really stellar results. I bought more shares this morning, and am reiterating a Buy.

I believe analysts’ consensus earnings could be a little conservative and Google should continue to beat estimates with better growth and operating margins.

Google's earnings quality is better than several tech giants for the following reasons.

* It has a near monopoly in Search
* Market leadership in media with YouTube.
* A strong first-mover advantage with Waymo.
* A fast-growing Google Cloud business, third only to and catching up with Azure and AWS.

**Its earnings and growth are sustainable, thus it deserves a better valuation and multiple.**

Let's take a closer look at Q3 earnings.

Q3 GAAP EPS came in at $2.12 per share, beating expectations of $1.85 per share $0.27, or 14% - **This was a substantial beat.**

Revenue of $88.3Bn (+14.9% Y/Y) beat by $2.05B or 3%.

Consolidated Alphabet revenues in Q3 2024 increased 15%, or 16% in constant currency, YoY to $88.3Bn reflecting strong momentum across the business.

Google Services revenues increased 13% to $76.5 billion, led by strength across Google Search & other, Google subscriptions, platforms, and YouTube ads.

**Total operating income increased 34% and operating margin percent jumped a huge 4.5% to 32%.**

Google Cloud revenues grew a whopping 35% to $11.4Bn led by accelerated growth in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) across AI Infrastructure, Generative AI Solutions, and core GCP products, **with record operating margins of 17%** as the cost per AI query decreased by 90% over the past 18 months.

Cloud titans Amazon (AWS) and Microsoft (Azure) have commanded huge valuations for their cloud computing businesses; with Google Cloud growing at 35%, it should continue to narrow the gap over the next 5 years. Also importantly, AWS and Azure have operating margins over 30%, and should Google continue to scale and leverage their existing fixed costs, they can reach the same margins. I also believe as they get better at AI, they should be able to charge more.

Based on consensus analysts’ estimates Alphabet’s EPS should grow to $11.60 in 2027 from $5.80 in 2023 - that’s an annual growth rate of 18%. Comparatively, Apple‘s estimated EPS growth through FY2027 is slower at 14%, and it sports a P/E of 33 compared to Google’s 22. Alphabet’s P/E is closer to the S&P 500’s P/E of 21!

I believe this is too low, and there is a lot of potential for its stock to appreciate on the lower valuation.

Besides the strong EPS, a lot of Google’s expenses are noncash depreciation and amortization and their cash flow margins are strong. They generated operating cash of $31Bn on $88Bn last quarter, or a 35% cash flow margin.

The antitrust regulation will remain a possible negative on Alphabet, but the final decision is still years away as Alphabet vigorously appeals the decision.

TSLA,The Contradiction of Warren Buffet's Avoidance of $TSLA,0,21,1730643644,"Hi investing friends, helping fellow like-minded people (where's the trading/day trading swing tradaing sub-reddit of r/investing by the way?) add their fundamentals. I'm 93/7 percent believe in Warren and Elon, meaning if they say 100 things, I will most like believe 93 or them 110%:

Although Warren Buffett and we must always do our best to surpass our heroes like all Olympic records are meant to be broken (coz' in part technology, rule change and medicine advances) or NBA stars like MJ surpassing their heroes and Warren Buffett is still the genius compared to 93.% of investors and traders (the remaining 7% are the other stars like Peter Lynch), he's also made a few mistakes (Amazon is the best example coz' he always insists he doesn't understand technology which is honestly not that hard to understand but may be hard to see the road ahead when the internet was democratized including made affordable for the common working man with a decent salary ala Henry Ford's speech):

granted he loves CEOs and founders who have a laid back personality that are orthodox but orthodox in the big way, like Tim Cook, and granted TSLA is overbought by saying TSLA has the market cap of the auto industry combined vs. it's book value (math part of things, ruled by figures/number so it's more a part of technical analysis still), is he avoiding TSLA because:

a)  Elon Musk's personality is the biggest Think Big of all Think Bigs in the industrial history (way bigger than Henry Ford or Vanderbilt and the others who built industrial america which spilled to the world) and he's not comfortable with that

b) or is it because it's personal coz' they had a little war on words in the interviews and on X/formerly Twitter?

If it's about a) then it contradicts with his being on the Left mindset (a democrat, I'm with team common sense by the way at the moment coz' it has clarity, consistency and specific solutions) coz' the Left is very unorthodoxed and sometimes even comically non-sensical, going way beyond common sense.

If it's b) that's even worse, coz' one's judgment must not be clouded as Graham and Warren have though themselves, big decisions must be logical not ruled by vibes and emotions.

Also, I feel Elon has had a tiff with Apple in the past with them pulling ads from Twitter/X, Elon trying to launch Tesla Phone and some history with Apple refusing to buy Tesla since Elon had put some shitty condition like he wants to be CEO of Apple as part of the deal.

GOOG,"Waymo opens robotaxi service to anyone in Los Angeles, marking its largest expansion yet",518,152,1731428027,"Alphabet-owned Waymo is removing the waitlist for its self-driving service in Los Angeles, marking its largest expansion yet.

Starting Tuesday, anyone in LA will be able to use the Waymo One app to hail a self-driving robotaxi throughout nearly 80 square miles of Los Angeles County, the company said. That includes the 300,000 Angelenos who have been on Waymo’s waitlist.

With more than 3.8 million people, LA marks the third and largest city where the company’s robotaxi service is now fully available. It follows San Francisco, where Waymo One opened citywide in June. The company opened the service in Phoenix in 2020.

“Now is an exciting time to welcome everyone in Los Angeles along for the ride,” Tekedra Mawakana, co-CEO of Waymo, said in a news release Tuesday. “Our service has matured quickly and our riders are embracing the many benefits of fully autonomous driving. We’re so grateful to all of our first riders in LA, and we can’t wait to serve more riders soon.”

The company has been rapidly expanding its operations over the last year thanks to additional funding.

Waymo closed a $5.6 billion funding round in October to expand its robotaxi service across the U.S. The autonomous vehicle venture is owned by Google parent Alphabet, which led the series C investment in Waymo, alongside earlier backers including Andreessen Horowitz, Fidelity, Perry Creek, Silver Lake, Tiger Global and T. Rowe Price.

The robotaxi company now sees more than 150,000 paid rides per week across its three markets via the Waymo One app, the company said Tuesday. That’s up from 100,000 in August.

Waymo in September announced that it partnered with Uber to launch its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, in 2025. The next-generation robotaxi from Waymo is a Geely Zeekr that’s equipped with custom sensors and an AI “driver.” Waymo also recently agreed to a multiyear strategic partnership with Hyundai that will add the South Korean automaker’s Ioniq 5 electric vehicle to its robotaxi fleet.

The Waymo One service has been embraced by some women who have safety concerns about riding with unknown human drivers. It has also been used by parents to send their teens to school.

MSFT,Palantir $PLTR is extremely overpriced.,269,198,1731943495,"**1. Valuation Metrics Are Sky-High**  
Palantir currently trades at a Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio of approximately 53.13, significantly higher than industry peers.

[GuruFocus](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/ps-ratio/PLTR) Even for a growth company, this level of valuation is extreme and implies future growth rates that may be unattainable.



**2. Revenue Growth Isn’t Scaling as Expected**  
While Palantir’s revenue growth has been solid, it’s showing signs of deceleration:

* FY 2022: 24% year-over-year growth
* FY 2023 (projected): 18% year-over-year growth

This deceleration doesn’t justify its premium valuation. Additionally, the company remains heavily reliant on government contracts, which are often lumpy and unpredictable.

**3. Profitability Is Still Questionable**  
Despite boasting about achieving GAAP profitability recently, Palantir has heavily relied on stock-based compensation (SBC). In fact, SBC accounted for approximately 30% of their operating expenses last quarter, which dilutes shareholder value and raises questions about true profitability.

**4. AI Hype Is Inflating the Bubble**  
The market has been overly optimistic about Palantir’s AI capabilities. While their AI Platform (AIP) sounds promising, actual adoption metrics and revenue contribution from AIP remain vague. It’s easy to talk AI; it’s harder to monetize it sustainably.

**5. Insider Selling Signals Lack of Confidence**  
Executives have been offloading shares at a significant rate. For instance, Chairman Peter Thiel sold a substantial portion of his holdings recently.

[Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/insiders-lead-sell-palantir-stock-223000919.html)If the leadership team doesn’t see long-term upside at these prices, why should we?



**6. Competitive Pressure Is Mounting**  
Palantir operates in a crowded space with competitors like Snowflake ($SNOW), Databricks, and Microsoft ($MSFT) offering similar or better solutions. Palantir’s dependence on government clients limits its commercial reach in comparison.

**TL;DR:**  
Palantir is an interesting company with solid tech, but the stock price is disconnected from fundamentals. High valuations, slowing growth, heavy SBC, and reliance on government contracts make $PLTR a risky bet at current levels. AI hype has driven the price into bubble territory, and insiders don’t seem confident in its future.

What do you think? Is $PLTR worth its valuation, or are we seeing another overhyped tech bubble? Let’s discuss! 👇

Of course I am, tell me more.  He puts me in contact with the private investment firm he used.  Now, even though i qualify as an accredited investor, I know zero of the PE space, so i did as much research as i could, but sometimes as an outsider you don't know the right questions to ask.   

So far what i can tell is they purchase blocks of spacex from hedges, place them in an spv and look for accredited investors.  The SPV is holding actual shares of spaceX.

25k minimum buy in.  5% up front management fee.  No maintenance fees, or other SPV fees.  There is a premium on the spaceX shares of $175/share  (effectively sold at a $328B valuation) as opposed to the $135 ($250B Valuation) tender offer that was just announced.  They take cut of profits via a 20% carrier interest.  A provision that if starlink is spun off, they'd give 1 starlink share for every 3 shares of the spacex spv you hold.   Finally an offer of money back (minus the 5% management fee) in 5 years if spacex doesn't so public.

If i'm doing my math right, if spaceX (and starlink combined) went public and 3x'ed from an aggregate value of $250B val to a $750B val, i'd roughly double my initial investment.

GOOG,Speculate on GOOG - what'd be the best countermove against DoJ slaps? ,219,229,1732470542,"For those who were sleeping/partying on the weekend, the following happened:

* DoJ said, Google should divest off Chrome and may not reenter the browser market for five years
* prohibited from ""acquiring any interests in search rivals, potential entrants, and rival search or search ads-related AI products""
* halt all ""anticompetitive payments to distributors, including Apple, Samsung"" so that Google isn't the default search engine on their devices
* content creators can choose to opt-out of Google crawlers to train its AI

Most obvious historical comparison is case against Microsoft Corp. in 2001; the DoJ tried to split Microsoft up due to its hold over the web browser market on Windows, though this case **ultimately resulted in a settlement**. With that in mind, it is possible, the DoJ will go this way, this time.

* Search is close to 50% revenue of Google \[Q3 results\]
* Browsers market shares: Chrome 60%, Safari 18%, Edge 8% \[Source can be contested, because it's larger devices stats only\]
* Android - 70% market share in handheld devices

GOOG has to fight hard to ensure a high search traffic. It may have a few options up its sleeves.

TSLA,Thesis: A Food  for Though on Fundamentals of TSLA in Relationship to the Era When Warren Buffet Was Born,0,3,1732906580,"Hi investing friends, granted calculations say TSLA is overbought by around 7 to 8x  but if we go back in time and imagine it's today, could TSLA be at an era when it was good for Warren to buy Wrigley's stocks or Coca Cola stocks?

I get Buffett's picks which are first en masse, second they are consumables, 3rd they are simple to make and simple to consume so the turnover for them to make them again is faster(nothing hard in making gum and softdrinks once perfected and there's nothing hard about chewing and drinking Coke), 4th don't require R and D at some point, I call them en masse consumables. But we have to define consumable, it doesn't have to stop with one person, it can go on to almost forever with the next generations.

Having said that could TSLA be the era for this generation and generations close to it: it's en masse, everybody needs to commute, driving's one's self is convenient, it's consumable in a way coz' you replace things like parts and the vehicle eventually (also energy is bought from Tesla via the superchargers among other things) and there's always new graduates to buy them, 3rd they are not simple to make compared to a gum but technology may have made up for that as it's as simple or close to the simplicity of making a gum (automation + now w/ A.I.), 4th it does require constant R and D but then again technology compensates for that as if there's not much further R and D (especially with A.I. helping with a vehicle's physics and material science).

TSLA,A Second or Third Revisit of Why Warren Buffet May Not Have Fully Understood TSLA When He Said Value is Equivalent to the Whole Car Industry,0,21,1733047478,"Hi investment friends, starting with the point of this analysis: Tesla, is a Wrigley's or a Coca Cola or our era but with a beyond imagining more future potential. 

Warren Buffett's although we love him, he's one of the top 7 wisest who ever lived and has the motto ""invest in things you understand"" (it should be added that there should at least be ample time to get to understand it coz' most are very much understandable or it's just pride to stick to simple to manufacturer but en masse consumables and the like as I call his favorites, assets like gum, candy, airlines and softdrinks which are everywhere and all customers are repeat customers) but there's still that constant, that he's not infallible. What it means to 'understand' has to be truly be analyzed way deeply than ever before.

As most have said in the tech industry, sir Warren's fundamental which includes that it's highly speculative (also it's not on the record but it implies he's not into Elon Musk's kind of personality which for him is unpredictable but that's another miss in the fundamental analysis of the one who leads Tesla) analysis of Tesla appears not to be fundamental at all coz' it's most likely incomplete. As most have said Tesla is not just a car company, it's not just a products company selling cars. What was once speculative and beyond the norm have materialized, an example is EV cars that are practical compared to EVs from generations past, now you have the many Models of Tesla. Elon Musk w/ Tesla has proof that they can execute what seems to be many as speculative (although I don't agree with him 100%, especially when it comes to 100% autonomy, coz' technology is buy a tool for mankind and will always babysit any technology).

Tesla is not just a car company, it's more than that- its an energy company (generating revenues energy services like charging and at the same time it ""ate it's own cake too"" as they say, it creates the products, the batteries to facilities that energy charging service), it's an A.I. company, solar energy company and a robotics company which is still at a speculation stage wether people will buy that but given Tesla w/ Elon's leadership, there's a high probability that Optimus will be practically used almost everywhere (just like again, EV as practical long range modes of transportation was a pipe dream until they launched en masse the Model S and the Models after that).

TSLA,Tesla: Unveiling the Overvaluation—A Comprehensive Analysis. Short Seller Report. (TSLA) Stock Equity Investing,1,0,1733372496,"Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) has emerged as one of the most polarizing entities in contemporary financial history, boasting a market capitalization surpassing the combined worth of established automakers such as Toyota, Ford, and General Motors. Although the company has undeniably transformed the automotive and energy sectors, our analysis indicates that Tesla's valuation is driven by speculative enthusiasm rather than enduring fundamentals.

This report highlights substantial concerns regarding Tesla's financial performance, competitive positioning, and speculative projects such as the Optimus robot. Utilizing a macroeconomic perspective, it incorporates the Buffett Indicator and Shiller P/E Ratio to position Tesla within a broader market bubble. Our analysis concludes that Tesla is overvalued by nearly every metric, presenting a strong case for re-evaluating investment in the company.

**Disconnect from Fundamentals** P/E and Market Multiples 

Tesla's valuation metrics are inflated to speculative levels, outpacing both its peers and historical precedents: 

**Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio (TTM):** Tesla’s Price-to-Earnings stands at **94.55**, far above the automotive industry average of 5-15. For context, NVIDIA (a high-growth tech company) trades at 62x, and Apple, with its mature, stable business model, trades at 30x. Even against leading tech companies, Tesla’s P/E ratio is disproportionately high. 

**Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio:** Tesla trades at 8.95x sales, while Toyota and Ford hover below 1x. By comparison, NVIDIA’s P/S is approximately 16x, justified by its dominance in high-margin, rapidly expanding AI markets. Tesla’s lower-margin automotive business does not command the same pricing power or scalability, making its P/S ratio harder to justify. 

**Enterprise Value to EBITDA:** Tesla’s EV/EBITDA: 81.72, significantly higher than traditional automakers like GM (\~7x) and Toyota (\~6x). 

Tech Companies EV/EBITDA: 

* NVIDIA (NVDA): \~41x (Q4 2024), driven by its dominance in AI and GPUs. 
* Apple (AAPL): \~24x (Q4 2024), reflecting its mature, high-margin ecosystem.

These valuations assume extraordinary growth and profitability far beyond what Tesla has demonstrated or is likely to achieve given intensifying competitive pressures and technological limitations. 

**Current Market Cap to GDP Ratio**: The Buffett Indicator stands at **208%**, indicating an extreme overvaluation of the U.S. stock market. Tesla’s significant influence within major indices intensifies this systemic risk.

**Shiller P/E Ratio Current S&P 500 CAPE:** At 36.5, the CAPE ratio is nearing levels seen before the dot-com bust and 1929 crash. Tesla’s inflated valuation amplifies the broader market distortion. 

**Financial Performance Analysis** 

Revenue Growth Deceleration Tesla’s revenue growth trajectory is losing momentum: Annual Growth Decline: From **51.35% in 2022 to 18.8%** **in 2023**. Quarterly Revenue Stagnation: Q3 2024 revenue of $25.18 billion represents a sequential decline of 1.25%. **Margin Compression** Tesla's once-dominant margins are eroding under competitive and operational pressures: **Gross Margin:** Dropped to **18.25%** in 2023, reflecting price cuts and rising input costs. **Operating Margin**: Declined to **9.19%**, signaling inefficiencies in scaling operations.

Tesla's profitability is heavily reliant on high-margin regulatory credit sales. Regulatory Credit Dependency Tesla earned $1.78 billion from regulatory credits in 2023, representing 1.8% of revenue but an outsized share of net income. As traditional automakers ramp up EV production, the demand for Tesla's credits will wane, threatening this vital income stream. 

Policy Risk: Potential deregulation under a new administration, such as Donald Trump’s rollback of EV mandates, could eliminate this revenue entirely. 

Free Cash Flow Volatility Annual **Free Cash Flow (FCF)**: Declined by **42.38%** YoY to $4.36 billion in 2023. CapEx Expansion: **Capital expenditures** surged to **$3.5 billion in Q3 2024**, reflecting heavy investments with uncertain ROI. 

Competitive Positioning: Eroding Leadership Market Share Under Siege Tesla’s once-dominant EV market share is eroding as competitors scale production: 

* BYD (China): Outpaced Tesla in global EV sales with a diversified, cost-efficient lineup. 
* Ford and GM (U.S.): Successfully launching competitive models like the F-150 Lightning and Chevy Bolt EUV. 

Volkswagen Group (Europe): Scaling production of the ID series to challenge Tesla in key markets. Limited Product Lineup Tesla offers only four primary models: Model S, 3, X, and Y. Delays in the Cybertruck and Tesla Semi have limited its ability to address growing demand for EV trucks and commercial vehicles. 

**Technological Limitations: The Autonomy Gap** 

Tesla's reliance on a Level 2 autonomous system, marketed as ""Full Self-Driving"" (FSD), raises significant safety concerns. Unlike its competitors, Tesla has faced public scrutiny and legal challenges over a troubling number of fatalities and accidents associated with its Autopilot and FSD systems. Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) system is limited to **SAE Level 2**, requiring constant driver supervision. Despite its branding as ""Full Self-Driving,"" Tesla's system lags behind competitors who are deploying higher levels of autonomy. Competitors Advancing in Autonomy 

* Waymo (**Alphabet**): Operating **Level 4** autonomous vehicles in urban and suburban environments, Waymo leverages a robust sensor suite, including lidar, radar, and cameras, to achieve safe, driverless navigation. 
   * Despite millions of miles driven in autonomous mode, Waymo has not reported any fatal accidents involving its vehicles. The company’s use of lidar, radar, and stringent testing protocols prioritizes safety above all else.
*  Cruise (**General Motors**): Similarly deploying **Level 4** autonomous vehicles, Cruise has demonstrated fully driverless operations in cities like San Francisco and Phoenix. 
   * Similarly, Cruise operates its autonomous fleet in complex urban environments without any recorded fatalities. Rigorous validation and oversight underpin its commitment to safety. 

**Mercedes-Benz**: Achieved **Level 3** autonomy, allowing drivers to disengage under specific conditions, and is actively scaling this capability in key markets like Germany.

* As a pioneer in achieving Level 3 autonomy, Mercedes-Benz adheres to strict European safety standards. The company has not been implicated in fatal incidents linked to its autonomous technology. 

**Tesla's Refusal to Adopt Lidar**: A Strategic Misstep Lidar, a gold standard for environmental perception in autonomous vehicles, is absent from Tesla’s sensor suite. While Tesla relies solely on cameras and neural networks, this approach limits its ability to detect objects with the precision and reliability required for higher levels of autonomy. Lidar offers redundancy and reliability in adverse conditions, such as poor weather or low visibility. Tesla’s omission of lidar raises safety and regulatory risks. 

Regulatory Roadblocks: Tesla's current system may struggle to meet the stringent safety standards required for **Level 4 or 5 autonomy**. The Business Model Constraint Tesla's refusal to adopt lidar is not solely technological—it is economic. Adding lidar would dramatically **increase production costs**, undermining Tesla’s ability to maintain competitive pricing in a margin-sensitive market. 

Cost Implications: The inclusion of lidar could add $1,000 to $2,000 per vehicle in hardware costs alone, compressing Tesla’s **already declining gross margins**. 

Reliance on Low Costs: Tesla’s market position **depends on producing vehicles at a relatively low cost**. Embracing lidar and other advanced sensors would necessitate higher vehicle prices or **reduced profitability**—both untenable given Tesla’s current valuation pressures. Tesla Will Struggle to Deliver a High-Quality, Level 5 Vehicle Tesla’s business model prioritizes cost efficiency over technological advancement. This approach limits Tesla’s ability to compete with high-quality offerings from rivals like Mercedes-Benz and Waymo. This makes the realization of a Level 5 fully autonomous vehicle—the holy grail of autonomy—highly unlikely in the foreseeable future. While also ensuring Tesla will continue to deliver lower-quality vehicles compared to competitors who balance advanced technology with rigorous quality standards. Tesla's technological and economic constraints reveal a fundamental flaw in its autonomy strategy. While competitors like Waymo, Cruise, and Mercedes-Benz lead the charge toward true self-driving vehicles, Tesla remains limited by its cost-driven model, prioritizing affordability over technological robustness. This gap will only widen as regulatory demands for safety and precision increase, further eroding Tesla’s competitive edge in the autonomy race. 

**Speculative Ventures: The Optimus Robot and Financial Impossibilities** Tesla’s foray into humanoid robotics through the Optimus project exemplifies speculative spending on unproven technologies. While CEO Elon Musk has branded Optimus as a revolutionary product that will transform industries, the financial and technological hurdles are insurmountable given Tesla’s existing commitments. 

Development Stage: Early and Unimpressive Current Optimus prototypes remain far from market ready. Demonstrations reveal robots controlled remotely, lacking the autonomy necessary to perform even basic tasks reliably. Musk has claimed Optimus will perform functions ranging from warehouse labor to elder care, yet no substantial evidence supports the viability of this vision in the near term. 

Competition: Boston Dynamics’ Atlas Robot: Years ahead in functionality and autonomy, Atlas showcases capabilities like complex navigation, load handling, and task performance, including construction-related activities. Tesla lags far behind established players like Boston Dynamics, whose decades-long focus on robotics has yielded tangible results. 

Optimus, in its current form, appears more akin to a marketing spectacle than a functional product. 

Tesla’s ability to deliver a viable Optimus robot, while maintaining profitability and fulfilling its other ambitious promises (such as Level 5 autonomy), faces significant financial constraints: 

**High Production Costs**: The estimated Bill of Materials (BOM) for Optimus is $50,000-$60,000 per unit, with components like robotic hands costing upwards of $10,000 alone. Scaling production to mass-market levels without compromising profitability would require unprecedented efficiency improvements, which Tesla has not demonstrated in its automotive business. 

Lack of Focus: Tesla is already grappling with **slowing vehicle sales**, **declining margins**, and the **high capital expenditure needed for its core EV business**. Simultaneously pursuing **Level 5 autonomy** and **humanoid robotics** is **financially and operationally unsustainable**. The Conflict Between FSD, Vehicles, and Optimus Tesla’s current valuation assumes success across multiple frontiers—producing low-cost vehicles, achieving full Level 5 autonomy, and scaling humanoid robotics. However, these goals are mutually exclusive given Tesla’s financial and technical limitations.

Level 5 Autonomy Challenges: Achieving this milestone requires heavy investment in lidar or other advanced sensor technologies that Tesla has eschewed to preserve margins. Without these investments, FSD remains stuck at Level 2, far behind competitors. 

Vehicle Profitability Risks: Tesla relies on cutting costs in its automotive production to maintain competitiveness. **Diverting resources** to **Optimus** would further strain vehicle **margins** and **reduce its ability to compete** in the increasingly crowded EV market. Successfully building Optimus at scale would demand massive R&D expenditures, high production costs, and extensive testing—placing further pressure on Tesla’s finances. 

Financial Risks to Shareholders Elon Musk’s vision for Optimus, paired with Tesla’s ongoing promises of Level 5 autonomy and affordable EVs, creates a trifecta of expectations that cannot be achieved simultaneously.

Investor Dilution Risk: Funding these speculative ventures may necessitate raising capital, diluting shareholder equity further. **Profitability at Risk**: Optimus development would drain resources needed to maintain Tesla’s **fragile profit margins**, which have already been compressed to **18.25%** **gross** margin in 2023. Credibility Concerns: Years of missed deadlines on promises like Level 5 autonomy raise doubts about Tesla’s ability to deliver on Musk’s bold claims, tarnishing investor confidence over time. **Tesla’s Optimus robot is emblematic of the company’s speculative spending and overpromised vision.** The inherent financial impossibilities of simultaneously scaling Optimus, achieving Level 5 autonomy, and maintaining vehicle profitability underscore a fundamental flaw in Tesla’s business strategy. 

Unlike its competitors, Tesla is spread too thin, risking operational focus, financial stability, and shareholder value. As Musk continues to promise breakthroughs, **the gap between reality and rhetoric only widens, making Tesla’s lofty ambitions increasingly untenable.** Operational Challenges Quality Control Issues Tesla continues to face manufacturing defects and recalls: High Recall Rate: Frequent recalls, including software glitches and mechanical failures, have raised concerns about **production quality.** Customer Complaints: Limited-service centers and long repair times **undermine Tesla’s brand reputation**. Tesla’s competitors have prioritized safety, employing rigorous testing, comprehensive sensor suites (including lidar), and conservative rollout strategies. This stark contrast underscores the risks of Tesla’s cost-cutting approach: **Inventory Build-Up** Tesla’s days of inventory increased to **28 days** in Q3 2024, suggesting weakening demand relative to production levels. 

Tesla has historically been a leader in electric vehicle (EV) battery technology, notably with its high energy density and efficient thermal management systems. However, competitors are rapidly advancing, challenging Tesla's dominance in this critical area. Competitors' Advances in Battery Technology 

* BYD's Blade Battery: BYD's Blade Battery utilizes lithium iron phosphate (LFP) chemistry, offering enhanced safety and longevity. Its thin, blade-like design allows for higher energy density and improved space utilization within the vehicle. 
* CATL's Qilin Battery: Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. (CATL) has developed the Qilin battery, which boasts a record-breaking volume utilization efficiency of 72% and an energy density of up to 255 Wh/kg. This enables longer driving ranges and faster charging times. 
* Solid-State Batteries: Companies like Toyota are investing in solid-state battery technology, which promises higher energy density, faster charging, and improved safety over traditional lithium-ion batteries. 

Tesla's introduction of the 4680 battery cells aims to **reduce costs** and improve vehicle range. These cells are larger and designed to be integrated into the vehicle's structure, enhancing efficiency. However, **production challenges have delayed their widespread implementation**, allowing competitors to narrow the technological gap. 

**Impact of Rising Lithium Prices** The EV industry is heavily reliant on lithium, a critical component in battery production. Recent trends indicate a significant increase in lithium prices due to supply constraints and escalating demand. **Lithium carbonate prices have surged, reaching unprecedented levels.** This escalation is attributed to the rapid growth in EV adoption and limited expansion in lithium extraction and processing capacities. Supply Constraints: The **International Energy Agency (IEA) warns of potential lithium shortages by 2025**, which could hinder the scaling of EV production globally. Implications for Tesla Cost Pressures: **Rising lithium prices directly impact battery production costs**. For Tesla, which aims to produce mass-market EVs at competitive prices, these **cost increases** could **compress profit margins** or necessitate higher vehicle prices, potentially reducing demand. 

Tesla's ambitious production targets may be jeopardized by lithium supply bottlenecks, leading to potential delays in vehicle deliveries and an inability to meet market demand. While Tesla remains a significant player in the EV market, its lead in battery technology is being challenged by competitors' innovations. Coupled with the financial pressures from rising lithium prices and potential supply shortages, Tesla faces substantial challenges in maintaining its competitive edge and profitability in the evolving EV landscape. 

**Legal and Regulatory Risks** 

* **Autopilot Investigations**: Multiple NHTSA probes into Autopilot-related accidents could result in costly recalls or fines. 
* **Misleading Marketing Claims:** Lawsuits alleging false advertising of Tesla’s FSD capabilities pose reputational and financial risks. Tesla’s valuation is built on speculative optimism that diverges significantly from its financial and operational realities. The company faces a convergence of critical challenges: 
* **Slowing Revenue Growth and Margin Compression**: Revenue growth has decelerated, while declining gross and operating margins highlight the financial strain of maintaining competitive pricing amidst rising costs. 
* **Reliance on Unsustainable Revenue Streams**: Regulatory credit sales, a key driver of profitability, are vulnerable to policy changes and decreasing demand as competitors ramp up EV production. 
* **Technological and Strategic Constraints**: Tesla’s Level 2 autonomy lags far behind competitors like Waymo and Cruise, who have deployed Level 4 solutions. The company’s refusal to adopt lidar reflects cost-driven compromises that limit its ability to achieve higher levels of safety and autonomy. 
* **Speculative Ventures:** The Optimus robot project exemplifies Tesla’s foray into high-risk, unproven technologies. Building and scaling Optimus while pursuing Level 5 autonomy and maintaining profitability is financially and operationally implausible. 
* **Eroding Market Position**: Tesla’s dominance in the EV market is waning, with competitors like BYD, Volkswagen, and GM offering cost-effective and innovative alternatives that threaten Tesla’s market share. 
* **Safety and Reputational Risks**: Fatalities linked to Tesla’s Autopilot underscore the dangers of overpromising and underdelivering, contrasting sharply with the safer, more transparent approaches of competitors. 
* **Challenges in Battery Technology**: While Tesla has historically led in battery innovation, competitors like BYD, CATL, and Toyota are closing the gap with advanced technologies like the Blade and Qilin batteries, as well as solid-state innovations. Production delays and scaling issues with Tesla’s 4680 cells further erode its competitive edge. 
* **Rising Costs of Key Commodities**: The surge in lithium prices and potential shortages of critical materials like cobalt and nickel threaten to increase production costs and compress margins. For Tesla, which relies on aggressive pricing to sustain demand, this adds a significant financial burden. 
* **Macro indicators such as the Buffett Indicator (208% of GDP) and the Shiller P/E Ratio (36.5)** place Tesla’s valuation within the context of broader market overvaluation, further amplifying the risk of a correction. 

Tesla’s ability to sustain its valuation assumes simultaneous success in producing low-cost vehicles, achieving Level 5 autonomy, and scaling speculative projects like Optimus—all while maintaining profitability and navigating intensifying competition. This multifaceted challenge is not only improbable but also exposes shareholders to significant downside risk. 

As competitors advance technologically, diversify product offerings, and secure more efficient supply chains, Tesla’s vulnerabilities become increasingly evident. Combined with macroeconomic pressures and systemic overvaluation, Tesla’s stock is poised for significant correction, making it a high-risk holding for investors.
